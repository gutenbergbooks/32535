<h2>PUSS JUNIOR AND ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>JACK SPRAT</h2>


<div class='cap'>ONE day as little Puss, Junior, was
traveling through New Mother Goose
country, he came to a funny little house all
covered with rose vines, even up to the top
of the small red chimney they grew in crimson
splendor. And as Puss stopped to look
at the pretty sight, a tiny blue bird in a cage
on the front porch began to sing:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Jack Sprat had a pig,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who was not very big;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He was not very lean</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He was not very fat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'He'll do for a grunt,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Says little Jack Sprat."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, ho," thought Puss, and he turned
into the yard and walked around to the little
red barn. There stood Jack Sprat himself,
leaning against the sty, watching his pig eat
his dinner.</p>

<p>Well, just then, all of a sudden, a swarm
of golden bees came humming into the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
farmyard, and before long they had made
a home in the empty beehive that stood
close by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/gs02.png" width="358" height="400" alt="Jack and the Pig" title="" />
</div>

<p>"You have brought me luck," said little
Jack Sprat, turning to Puss. "Now I shall
have honey, and with bees and a pig I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
grow rich and supply all Mother Goose
Country with good things to eat." And
would you believe it, the pig began to grow
fat, and the bees to buzz out of the hive and
wing their way over to the roses for sweets
with which to make their honey.</p>

<p>Then Jack Sprat asked Puss to come into
his little house, and when he went to the
cupboard to look for bread and butter, he
found all kinds of good things to eat.</p>

<p>"What luck you have brought me," said
little Jack Sprat, but Puss was as much surprised
as he. But pretty soon when they had
sat down to the table, they heard a strange
little voice from the hearth, and looking down
they saw a tiny black cricket, who began to
sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I'm just a little cricket,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But if you'll let me stay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Within your house this winter</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You will not rue the day."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"It is the little cricket that brings you
luck," said truthful little Puss, Junior. And
then Jack Sprat began to laugh happily, for
up to this time the pig was the only thing he
owned, and that wasn't very much, let me tell
you. Oh, dear, no. Not in these hard times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
when eggs are worth their weight in gold and
a gallon of milk costs a ton of silver.</p>

<p>Well, by and by, Puss, Junior, once more
went on his way, and perhaps pretty soon
he'll find his father, the famous Puss in
Boots, unless,</p>

<div class='poem'>
A great big husky giant<br />
Jumps into a trolley car,<br />
And turns the coin box upside down<br />
To see how many nickels there are.<br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE YELLOW HEN</h2>


<div class='cap'>WELL, a big husky giant didn't jump
into the trolley car, as I feared he
might in the last story, so little Puss, Junior,
kept up his search for his dear father until
late in the evening when he came to a city on
Goosey Gander River. For the moment I've
forgotten the name, but if I remember it I
will tell you later. At any rate, it won't
matter much, for Puss didn't stay there long.
Well, as I was saying, he entered the city,
tired and hungry, for he had traveled far
that day, and as he walked up the brightly
lighted street he heard a man say:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Saw ye aught of my love a-coming from the Opera?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Around her throat a string of pearls,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And on her neck two little curls;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Saw ye aught of my love a-coming from the Opera?</span><br />
</div>

<p>"My good man, I'm a stranger and have
just arrived. I have seen no string of pearls
nor little curls on any pretty little girls,"
answered Puss wearily, for he was too anxious
to find a night's lodging to notice pearls and
curls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me!" sighed the man, and he took
off his opera hat and flattened it and then
snapped it out again, which made a little
newsboy open his eyes and say, "Do it again,
Mister; it sounds like a pistol." But the
man wouldn't, so the little newsboy ran off
and Puss turned away, for he had no time
to be talking to operagoers at that time of
evening. By and by he came to a narrow
street at the end of which shone a little light.
So he turned down and presently found himself
in front of a little house. In the hammock
on the front porch sat a pretty yellow
hen, swinging back and forth, and every now
and then singing to herself:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"It's after ten! It's after ten!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Time for bed for Yellow Hen."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Good evening!" said Puss, taking off his
plumed hat and bowing politely. "May I
ask for a night's lodging. I'm tired and
footsore, and have traveled many miles in
New Mother Goose Country."</p>

<p>The little Yellow Hen flapped her wings
and fluttered down to the piazza. "Come,"
she said, stretching out her right wing.
"Travelers are always welcome. We hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
little down at the end of this narrow street.
Tell me some news, my good Sir Cat."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are not too sleepy?"
asked Puss. "It was only a few minutes ago
you were singing 'It's after ten, it's after ten;
time for bed for Yellow Hen!'" But the
little hen only laughed and said, "I must wait
up for Mr. Rooster."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He's the Cock at early dawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who blows on the Mayor's auto horn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To wake the city and stir the men</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To be up and at their work again."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Just then a gaily feathered rooster walked
up the steps, but what he said I shall have to
tell you in the next story, for it's so late now
that I must say good-night.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<h2>DICKORY DARE PIG</h2>


<div class='cap'>YOU remember, I hope, where I left off
in the last story&mdash;just as the rooster
came up the steps of the little house at the
end of the narrow street where Puss, Junior,
was making a call on the little Yellow Hen.
Well, he was very much surprised to see our
small traveler, but nevertheless he was most
polite. He stretched forth his right wing to
shake hands when, all of a sudden,</div>

<div class='poem'>
Dickory, dickory, dare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pig flew up the stair,</span><br />
A very funny thing to do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made the rooster doodle-doo.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Gracious me! Oh me, Oh my!" screamed
the little Yellow Hen. "That awful pig will
just spoil my stair carpet." This made the
rooster all the more angry at the Dickory
Dare Pig, as he called him, and he strutted
across the piazza. "I'll spur him when he
comes down," he said, and he waited at the
front door. But Mr. Pig took no chances.
He staid upstairs until the little Yellow Hen
began to cry. "I want to go to bed." Puss,
by this time, was also very sleepy, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
gaily feathered rooster&mdash;well, I think he was
half asleep, as he stood by the front door,
with his head tucked under his wing.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He'll forget to crow in the early morn;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And little Boy Blue with his silver horn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is always asleep, so what shall I do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If my Rooster sleeps the whole night through?"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="252" height="350" alt="Pig on stairs" title="" />
</div>

<p>"It's time for me to do something," exclaimed
Puss, Junior, whipping out his sword
and running upstairs two at a time. But,
would you believe it if I told you, he couldn't
find the Dickory Dare Pig anywhere? Puss
looked in every room and in every closet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
He even lifted the cover of the big clothes
hamper that stood in the bathroom, but Mr.
Pig was not to be found.</p>

<p>Well, after a while, Puss looked out of
the window. There on the roof of the porch
was the Dickory Dare Pig. "What are you
doing?" asked Puss, and he waved his sword
threateningly. But the Pig only grunted.</p>

<p>"You people downstairs are making an
awful fuss," and he closed his eyes again, he
was so sleepy. And, anyway, he had a very
nice soft place, for he had spread a big woolen
comforter on the roof for a bed.</p>

<p>"Well, you get out of here," said Puss.
"You have no right to take the Yellow Hen's
nice comforter, nor have you any right to
sleep on the roof, and if you don't go I'll
stick my sword in you." Well, after that,
the Pig ran downstairs and out of the front
door, and maybe he's running yet, if a butcher
hasn't caught him and made him into little
sausages.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<h2>THROUGH THE FOREST</h2>


<div class='cap'>YOU remember when we left off in the
last story, Puss had just made the
Dickory Dare Pig get off the roof of the
Yellow Hen's front piazza, after which the
gaily feathered rooster and the Yellow Hen
and Puss, Junior, went to sleep, which they
couldn't do before on account of that dreadful
pig snoring. Well, he never came back,
for he was so afraid of Puss, Junior's, sword,
that he kept on running until he lost his
shadow, spent a year and a day hunting for
it, and after that he sat down and rested.</div>

<p>The next morning bright and early, just
as the sun was waking up in the East, the
gaily feathered Rooster began to blow his
silver horn to wake the people before the
morn, and some got cross when they heard his
song, but others hurried their dressing along,
and pretty soon Puss was dressed and the
little Yellow Hen combed her feathers and
came down to breakfast. And while they
were at the table, the Rooster came in and
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who went to market her eggs to sell.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As she went to market her eggs to sell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the asphalt pavement she slipped and fell.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then came a policeman whose name was Stout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When he saw all the eggs lying strewn about,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He said, 'What is this, a river of eggs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Too bad, my old woman, you slipped on your legs!'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then he helped the little old woman to stand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And placing a new dollar bill in her hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He said, 'My old woman, don't scramble your eggs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the pavement again by losing your legs.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I'll never let her take my eggs to market,"
said the Yellow Hen, and the Rooster flapped
his wings and crowed, he was so glad. And
after that Puss, Junior, said good-by and
went upon his journey, and by and by he
came to a forest. Now this forest was full
of bold robbers, but Puss didn't know that,
so he walked in and by and by he came to a
little hut. From the chimney a thin gray
feather of smoke slowly made its way up
through the tall tree tops, and around the
front door climbed a wild vine. Puss went
up boldly and knocked and when the door
opened he saw a fox. At first he was somewhat
frightened, but the fox said, "Come in,
Sir Cat," so our little traveler entered and
sat down.</p>

<p>Then the fox asked him where he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
going. "To see my dear father, the famous
Puss in Boots," replied little Puss, Junior.
"It's not very far from here," answered the
fox, "but the way is dangerous. Many robbers
lie in wait for the unwary traveler."</p>

<p>"I have my trusty sword," cried Puss, "I'm
not afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, since you are so brave, I will help
you," said the fox; "I know a way and will
show you how you may escape the robbers."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h2>A TURTLE AND A FISH</h2>


<div class='cap'>AS I told you in the last story, the Fox
promised to help Puss and pretty soon
he led him out of the little log house and
through a thick undergrowth of young timber
until they came to a river. "Now, the
robbers will never think for a moment that
you would travel by water," said the Fox
with a grin. "Here is a little boat," and he
pushed aside the bushes behind which lay a
rowboat with a pair of oars.</div>

<p>As Puss got in, the Fox gave him some
parting directions. "Follow the stream until
you come to a lake. Then leave your boat
and follow the right bank until you come to
a bridge. After that you will find the highway
which will take you to the castle of my
Lord of Carabas, where your famous father,
Puss in Boots, lives."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good friend," cried our
little hero, pushing off from the shore, and
in a few minutes he was gliding down the
stream.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" he sighed. "This is a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
way to travel, but I have had many experiences,
so why not a rowboat instead of a
gander or an automobile," and he bent to
his rowing and by and by he came to a bend
in the river, and as it was late in the afternoon,
he decided to land and camp for the
night. But no sooner had he landed on the
bank than a large turtle came up to him and
said:</p>

<p>"This is Turtle Island. No one is allowed
to land unless he has a permit." Of course,
little Puss, Junior, didn't have one, but after
a moment's reflection, he said:</p>

<p>"I am about to visit my father, the famous
Puss in Boots, and if I cannot remain here
for the night, I may have an accident on the
river. Please let me stay."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Turtle, scratching
his head, "you may remain on my island,"
and then he crawled away to his own house
on the hill, which Puss could see in the distance.
I think the Turtle was a disagreeable
sort of person not to have asked our little
traveler to spend the night with him, but
then, you know, there are some disagreeable
people even in New Mother Goose Country,
and the Turtle was one of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, bright and early, Puss,
Junior, got up and cooked his breakfast, and
then he jumped into his rowboat and started
off and by and by, as he was gliding along,
a big fish came up to the surface and said,
"Helloa, there!" At first Puss was startled,
for he didn't see the fish, but as soon as he
did, he replied:</p>

<p>"Don't get in my way! I might push my
oar in your eye." This made the fish laugh so
hard that he cried, and after that he laughed
some more, only he didn't cry that time.
"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To the castle of my Lord of Carabas,"
replied Puss.</p>

<p>"A long journey, my brave little cat," said
the fish, "but keep up a brave heart. You
are already more than half way across New
Mother Goose Country."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>PUSS FINDS A SUPPER</h2>


<div class='cap'>FOR many days Puss, Junior, traveled in
his boat down the river and towards
evening he heard a voice on the shore singing:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Rock-a-by baby, thy cradle is green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dad's a policeman, the finest yet seen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And mother's a lady and goes to a ball,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Johnny's a member of Tammany Hall."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Of course this made our little traveler
laugh, for he didn't know there was a Tammany
Hall in New Mother Goose Country
and neither did I until Puss told me.</p>

<p>Well, he pulled his boat up on the bank
and got out, and after that he listened again
for the song, but there wasn't a sound, so
he thought the baby must be asleep. Then
he tiptoed over to a little cottage nearby and
looked in the window. There sat a pretty
little woman with a baby in her arms. And
when she saw Puss she lifted her finger very
gently to let him know that her baby was in
the Land of Nod, and after that she placed
him gently in the cradle.</p>

<p>"Come in," she whispered to our little
pussy cat traveler and when they were in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
nice bright kitchen, for the fire in the stove
made bright streaks of light over the clean
floor, she said:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="332" height="400" alt="Woman rocking baby" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Sir Cat, you are a traveler, I see. Tell
me one of your adventures while I get the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
supper. My good man will soon be home,
hungry and tired from his day's work."</p>

<p>Now Puss, Junior, was tired, too, and he
didn't feel a bit like sitting down and telling
a story. But he was an obliging little pussy
and he knew, like Little Tommy Tucker,
he must pay for his supper.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," he began, "there was
a famous cat, and the reason he was so famous
was because he had done a great favor
for his master. You see, his master was the
youngest of three sons, who, when his father
died, got nothing but the cat, while the others
got the farm and the money. But he never
complained, which so pleased the cat that he
made up his mind to help his young master.
And what do you think he did? One day
his master's clothes were stolen while in bathing,
and the king, who was passing by at that
moment in his coach, felt so sorry that he
gave the young man a beautiful suit and
asked him to drive with him. Of course the
cat went, too, and as they passed along he
waved his paw and said, 'All these lands
belong to my master.' By and by they came
to a castle where lived a giant. So the cat
ran ahead, and said to the giant, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sitting in his big room; 'I hear you can change
yourself into anything. Let me see if you
can turn into a mouse!' 'That's easy!'
laughed the foolish giant. Whereupon this
wise cat ate him up. And when the king
arrived, he said, 'Here is my master's castle;'
which so pleased the king that he gave his
daughter to wed and the young man never
forgot how his cat helped him to fame and
fortune. And this cat is my father," concluded
little Puss, Junior, with a bow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>ARKVILLE</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning when Puss, Junior,
went down to the river, he found his
boat was gone.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="274" height="350" alt="Walking in the rain" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Now I must trust again to my red-topped
boots," he sighed, and at once set off to find
his dear father. By and by he saw a little
man in the distance, who, on coming nearer,
turned out to be Tom Thumb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Puss picked him up and placing him on his
shoulder, set off once more. But, goodness
me! It soon began to rain, and Tom Thumb
crept into a pocket to keep dry.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the day they
arrived on the outskirts of a small village.
In the distance they could hear the strokes
of a hammer, and then, now and again, the
whirr of a saw cutting into hard wood.</p>

<p>"What's going on, I wonder?" said Tom
Thumb; "sounds as if they were building a
house."</p>

<p>"Don't know," answered Puss, "but let's
hurry, for I am soaked to the skin."</p>

<p>On arriving in the village they saw what
appeared to be an immense boat in the early
stages of construction. It was being erected
in the city square, the little park that stood
in the midst of the stores and houses.</p>

<p>Drawing nearer they heard a voice singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Noah of old did build an Ark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of spicy gopherwood and bark</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To float upon the deluge dark.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now on this Ark they had no sail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For it was made (and true the tale)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Without a mast to break the gale."</span><br />
</div>

<p>When Puss and Tom halted at the side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the Ark a kind-looking man stopped his
hammering and said:</p>

<p>"It's going to rain for forty days and
forty nights. There's going to be an awful
deluge. You'd better stay in Arkville and
get aboard the Ark as soon as it's finished.
If you don't you'll get drowned."</p>

<p>"He speaks the truth, I'm thinking,"
answered Tom Thumb, peeping out of Puss,
Junior's, pocket. "It looks to me as if the
rain were never going to stop."</p>

<p>"My good sir," said Puss, turning to the
man, "it seems to me your advice is good.
We'll stay in Arkville for a few days. But
where shall we stop? Is there a hotel near?"</p>

<p>"Over yonder is the Hotel Ark," said the
man. "I'm the proprietor, and my name is
Noah. Go in and make yourselves at home.
My sons and I will follow you shortly. We
have a few more nails to drive before we quit
for the day."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOTEL ARK</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE Hotel Ark was a comfortable sort
of a place, not very up-to-date, but with
enough conveniences to make the traveler
perfectly at home. He felt even more so
after meeting the proprietor's wife, Mrs.
Noah, a motherly-looking woman, with kind
blue eyes and red cheeks.</div>

<p>"Come right in," she said as Puss, Junior,
and Tom Thumb, both wet to the skin,
rapped on the door.</p>

<p>"You'd best dry yourselves in the kitchen,"
she said, leading them down a narrow hall.
"It's so warm in there you'll be dry in no
time."</p>

<p>This was good news to our two small travelers,
for their teeth were chattering like
twenty-four small white horses on a red hill.</p>

<p>"Here's a chair for you and here's a chair
for Tom Thumb," said Mrs. Noah. "I'm
not sure about your name, but I can't mistake
that of your little friend." Puss, Junior,
turned and bowed. Although he was wet, he
did not forget his manners. "My name is
Puss in Boots, Junior."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," cried Mrs. Noah,
"I might have known it."</p>

<p>The kitchen fire was burning merrily,
bright flames shot up the chimney and sparks
from the wood flew out like stars upon the
polished floor. Puss pulled off his dripping
hat and laid it down on the chair. The
feather was much bedraggled and had lost its
wave. Tom Thumb undid his coat and hung
it up, and then took off his shoes and placed
them close to the hearth.</p>

<p>"I think my boots are half full of water,"
said Puss, Junior; "they are as heavy as
lead, and when I walk they make a funny
noise." They certainly were full of water,
for when Puss finally got them off and turned
them over, a stream of water ran down the
floor, nearly washing Tom Thumb across the
room.</p>

<p>By the time their clothes were dry, Noah
and his three sons arrived for supper.</p>

<p>"Still raining!" said the good man, as he
closed the door. "I must finish the Ark
to-morrow. We may find a lake around the
hotel by the morning. Who can tell? But
I shall be ready to take in all the animals and
my family by noon at the latest."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<h2>ALL ABOARD</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="333" height="400" alt="Bow of ship" title="" />
</div>

<div class='cap'>IT was still raining when Puss, Junior, and
Tom Thumb awoke. They had spent a
comfortable night at the Hotel Ark and felt
much refreshed. After a hearty breakfast
they again looked out of the window. The
rain was still coming down in torrents, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
water lay inches deep upon the street. The
Hotel Ark was surrounded by a shallow lake
which, however, was growing deeper every
minute.</div>

<p>Puss, Junior, stepped out upon the veranda
and looked over the village square.
Through the rain he could make out the outlines
of the Ark. Just then a voice began to
sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He built it high, he built it strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He built it wide, he built it long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To hold a jolly, motley throng."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Pretty soon Noah himself came splashing
through the water toward the hotel.</p>

<p>"There is no time to lose," he cried, "the
Ark will soon be afloat. Mother, make haste.
Tell the girls to come along. We've no time
to lose." Mrs. Noah appeared almost immediately,
followed by the wives of her three
sons. Lifting up their skirts, they waded
after Noah. Puss, Junior, picked up Tom
Thumb and placed him on his shoulder.
From far and near, from the forest and the
plain, from everywhere, the animals came
hurrying up.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There were the Elephant and Bee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Hippopotamus and Flea,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The tall Giraffe and Chick-a-dee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Cock-a-doodle and the Ass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And three young men, each with his lass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shem, Ham and Japhet had a pass!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Noah of old, and Noah's dame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I think I never heard her name,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But she went in tho' all the same."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"This reminds me of the circus," laughed
Puss, Junior. "I once was with a circus;
three days or so; whenever I see an elephant
I think of my circus days."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/gs07.png" width="274" height="350" alt="Animals coming to the ark" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Let down the gang-plank," commanded
Noah, and soon a long procession of animals
began to enter the Ark. The rain kept up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
its heavy downpour and by noon the water
was waist deep. All the smaller animals had
come aboard and Captain Noah (as he was
now called) felt certain by evening he would
be able to start on his voyage.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<h2>PRECIOUS MOTHER GOOSE</h2>


<div class='cap'>AS the last animal came on deck and the
Noah boys hauled in the gang-plank,
the ark began rolling heavily, for the wind
was high and the water rough. "Are we
sure every one is aboard?" asked Captain
Noah,</div>

<div class='poem'>
"But best of all, my little dears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Twill most delight your listening ears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So give with me three mighty cheers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To hear that sheltered by that truce,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Loved more than Monkey, Owl or Moose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In walked Your Precious Mother Goose!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>If there was anyone more delighted than
Puss, Junior, he could not be found aboard
the Ark. To once more see Mother Goose
who had so kindly carried him on her Gander
many miles filled him with delight. He ran
forward to greet her as she alighted from her
faithful Gander.</p>

<p>"Mother Goose! Mother Goose!" cried
Puss, "I'm so glad to see you again."</p>

<p>"Let us go in. It's getting dreadfully wet
outside," she replied giving him a big hug.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin all was dry and cheerful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Mrs. Noah had the stove burning brightly
and her three daughter-in-laws were busy;
getting supper.</p>

<p>"Let me take your bonnet," said Mrs.
Noah and before that dear old lady could
remove her headgear, Mrs. Noah had taken
out the big pin and undone the strings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/gs08.png" width="270" height="350" alt="Mother Goose and goose" title="" />
</div>

<p>"There, make yourself comfortable," she
cried, pushing forward a rocking-chair.
"And have you found your father?" asked
the Gander, for he and Puss were having a
fine time talking over old times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, not yet," answered Puss sadly, "But
I hear he is Seneschal at the castle of my
Lord of Carabas."</p>

<p>"You must be patient," answered the Gander.
"And go in search of more adventures."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Puss, "and I have with
me my good comrade, Tom Thumb."</p>

<p>"All ashore that's going ashore," shouted
the hoarse voice of Captain Noah. Then
came the tinkle-jingle of the bell and the Ark
quivered from bow to stern, and in another
moment was off on the dark waters.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2>CAPTAIN NOAH</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE first night on the Ark was most
uncomfortable. It was not an easy
thing to provide sleeping quarters for the
animals, and although Captain Noah and his
three sons did their best, from the complaints
that were heard in the morning, it was easy to
see that very few were satisfied.</div>

<p>"We must get up a set of rules and regulations,"
said Captain Noah at the breakfast
table. "It's all very well to carry a cargo of
coal or salt but when it comes to animals it's
quite another thing. Each animal is so
blamed different," and Captain Noah heaved
a great sigh as he lifted the steaming cup of
coffee to his lips.</p>

<p>Puss, Junior, and Tom Thumb had risen
with the sun&mdash;that is, I should say, at an
early hour, for of course there was no sun.
No, indeed, there was nothing but rain and
a wide expanse of water. Water, water,
everywhere, but not a speck of dirt. The
whole world seemed nothing but water. The
only thing that wasn't water was the Ark and
its passengers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>However, this did not keep Puss, Junior,
and Tom Thumb from eating a hearty breakfast.
They were good travelers, whether by
land or sea, and to Puss, who had passed
through many a dangerous adventure, the
present situation seemed one of great interest.</p>

<p>Mother Goose was also in high spirits.
Turning to Captain Noah, she said:</p>

<p>"My dear Captain, if it weren't for you, I
hardly know what in the world I should have
done. To fly on gander-back through the
rain for forty days and nights would be
impossible, so I have you to thank for my
deliverance."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, my dear Mother
Goose," replied Captain Noah. "I did only
what was my duty. You know, I have
always been the Weatherman of Arkville,
and, if I do say it, I have hit the mark every
time. I knew, in fact, I felt, that we were to
have forty days and forty nights of rain.
For the last two weeks I have published this
in the Arkville News. To have the Ark finished
in time was my greatest ambition, and
now to reach Mount Ararat will be the
crowning joy of my career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"We didn't know where we were at,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One wide river,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Until we bumped on Ararat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One wide river to cross."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I've so often heard that song at the Minstrels,"
said Mother Goose, "that I believe
it's really coming true."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<h2>FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE Ark was an exceedingly good sea
craft. It rode the waves and breasted
the gale without a mishap. Some of the animals
became sea sick. But this, of course,
was to be expected. Even Captain Noah
himself felt rather queer at times, and as for
little Tom Thumb, he kept to his bed for almost
a week. Puss, Junior, proved to be a
very fine sailor. Not once did he feel the
least bit ill, and was able to help Mrs. Noah
attend to the sick passengers.</div>

<p>Of all the animals, however, the elephant
was the most sea sick.</p>

<p>"Of course, it had to be the biggest animal!"
said Captain Noah at breakfast one
morning. "Too bad, my dear," turning to
Mrs. Noah, "that you have such an unwieldy
patient on your hands." Mrs. Noah only
smiled.</p>

<p>"He does very little complaining," replied
Mrs. Noah, "that is one thing to be thankful
for. Now, take the little black ant. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
does nothing but complain all the time. I'd
rather attend to the elephant ten times over."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, you always had something
to be thankful for at the Ark Hotel. I'm
glad that on board the Ark you still keep
your cheerful disposition!" answered Captain
Noah.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">

</div>

<p>But, oh, dear me! Pretty soon Puss,
Junior, and Tom Thumb wondered if the
forty days and forty nights would ever end
and if the rain would ever stop. At last, one
day, it seemed as if the sun were trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
break through the clouds. And then, all of
a sudden, the rain ceased, and in the distance
the dim outline of a mountain appeared
through the mist.</p>

<p>At once the animals began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We didn't know where we were at,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One wide river,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Until we bumped on Ararat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One wide river to cross."</span><br />
</div>

<p>As if in obedience to the words of the song
the Ark grounded, the sun came out from the
clouds, and every one knew the voyage was at
an end, for</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The Ark she landed high and dry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One wide river,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the monkey kissed the cow good-by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One wide river to cross."</span><br />
</div>

<p>In a few minutes the gang-plank was lowered
and the animals landed. Captain Noah
was the last to leave.</p>

<p>"Well," he exclaimed, "we have passed
through an awful lot. But we're safe on
land again." "Hurrah!" shouted all the animals,
"we're safe at last!"</p>

<h2>UP AND DOWN</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
WHAT is the news of the day,<br />
Good neighbors, I pray?<br />
They say the balloon<br />
Is gone up to the moon.<br />
</div></div>

<p>It was the day of the county fair. Puss,
Junior, had bought his ticket and stood looking
about him uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>"They say the balloon has gone up to the
moon," cried the crowd.</p>

<p>"Why, I've been up to the moon," said
Puss, Junior, "but never will I get excited
over that?" But, nevertheless, he walked up
to the balloon man and asked. "When does
your next balloon go up?"</p>

<p>"In about five minutes," replied the owner
of the air craft. "We have an ascension
every half hour."</p>

<p>"Well," replied our little hero, "I would
like to be one of your passengers!"</p>

<p>"Pay your shilling and you shall have a
seat in the basket," answered the owner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/gs10.png" width="332" height="400" alt="Puss leaned over the edge" title="" />
</div>

<p>After waiting for perhaps an hour the
basket car was filled. My, how the people
cheered as the balloon ascended, and when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had almost reached the clouds Puss leaned
over the edge of the basket and threw little
notes down to the people below. "Tell my
good friends that Puss in Boots, Junior, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
gone up in a balloon," he wrote on one of
them.</p>

<p>On another, he scribbled, "Puss in Boots,
Junior, is about to visit the Man in the
Moon."</p>

<p>"You had better be careful," said the owner
of the balloon, "how do I know we'll reach
the moon?"</p>

<p>"If you follow my directions you will,"
replied Puss, Junior, "for I have been there
before and, to tell you the truth, it is a most
remarkable place. The moon is an unexplored
country."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take your word for it," said the
navigator of the balloon express. "I don't
know much about these sky roads, but if
you'll kindly consent to tell me where to steer
my air craft, perhaps we'll reach the moon
without a mishap."</p>

<p>"Trust to me," said Puss, Junior, "for I
have traveled far and if I don't know the
way to the moon, my name is not Puss in
Boots, Junior."</p>

<p>So the owner of the balloon steered the big
air craft straight up to the sky. Oh, dear
me! But strange things will happen! For
as they were sailing along as smoothly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
could be, there came a sudden gust of wind,
and the balloon, instead of pointing for the
big, round moon that shone like a silver dollar
overhead, suddenly swerved to one side and
before anyone could say "Jack Robinson"
there was a dreadful explosion and Puss and
his fellow passengers found themselves falling
to the earth.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Puss. "What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>Before his question was answered the balloon
crashed into a big willow tree.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>ROCK-A-BY</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was lucky that the balloon fell into the
big willow tree, as I mentioned in the last
story, for otherwise Puss, Junior, and his fellow
passengers might have been badly hurt.
As it happened, they were none the worse
except for a few scratches. Puss pulled himself
together and after arranging his clothes,
which were torn and mussed by the branches
of the tree, looked about him. Suddenly,
he heard the cry of a baby, and turning
around, he saw a little cradle swinging back
and forth. It was fastened securely to a
limb, and rocked to and fro as the breeze blew
through the trembling leaves.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Rock-a-by, baby, upon the tree top!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the wind blows the cradle will rock;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the bough breaks the cradle will fall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down tumbles baby, cradle and all."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"S-s-sh!" cried the balloon man, "We will
wake the baby if we are not careful."</p>

<p>"Won't it be sad if the bough breaks," said
Puss, Junior, "it will be almost as bad for the
baby as it was for us when the balloon fell
into this tree."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"It might be worse," said one of the passengers,
who stood near them on a limb, looking
anxiously to the ground.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take down the cradle," said
the balloon man.</p>

<p>"Somebody must have hung it up here,"
said Puss, "we have no right to take it down;
it's not our baby."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right," said another
passenger. "It isn't our cradle and it isn't
our baby, so the best thing for us to do is to
leave the cradle and climb down."</p>

<p>As soon as the passengers were once more
upon the ground they demanded their fare
back, saying that they had paid for a trip
to the moon, and not for a fall into a willow
tree.</p>

<p>"This doesn't seem quite fair to me,"
remarked the balloon man, looking ruefully
at his wrecked balloon. "I don't think I
should give you back more than half, for the
first part of the journey was successful."</p>

<p>"You didn't keep to your bargain," cried
Puss, stoutly; "and besides, you endangered
our lives. I don't want to pay to go up in
the air a little way and then be hurled down
into a willow tree; it takes all the niceness out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the way up and makes the way down too
dangerous."</p>

<p>So the balloon man paid back the money
and turned away. "Why don't you take the
basket car with you?" asked Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"It's too big to carry," replied the balloon
man. "I'll come around for it to-morrow
with a horse and wagon."</p>

<p>Pretty soon all the passengers had gone,
leaving Puss alone under the willow tree.
All of a sudden the baby began to cry, so
Puss sang softly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Hush-a-by, baby, upon the tree top,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the wind blows the cradle will rock."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And then the baby stopped crying, so Puss
turned away and entered the old mill that
stood in the shade of the old willow tree.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE ROCK-A-BY BABY</h2>


<div class='cap'>"WELCOME, Sir Cat," said the dusty
miller. "Sit down and tell me the
news." But just then a sweet voice commenced
to sing:</div>

<div class='poem'>
Down in the village all the long day<br />
Mother's been toiling the hours away;<br />
While up in the tree-top beneath the blue sky<br />
Baby has rocked to the wind's lullaby.<br />
<br />
Waiting is over, my sweet little one,<br />
Mother is here for her own blue-eyed son.<br />
Home we will go, and baby shall rest,<br />
All the night through on mother's warm breast.<br />
</div>

<p>"Dearie me," suddenly exclaimed the
dusty miller, "how tired she looks," and he
walked to the door.</p>

<p>"Let me carry the cradle," said Puss, and
lifting it on his shoulder, followed the grateful
little woman down the road.</p>

<p>When they reached the house Puss was
tired, for the cradle was heavy, and had nearly
slipped off his shoulder two or three times,
and once, when the baby caught hold of it,
Puss nearly stumbled.</p>

<p>"Come and rest," said the baby's mother,
opening the little wicket gate in the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fence. Puss looked up at the pretty porch,
covered with a honeysuckle vine. "Thank
you," he answered, "I will," and he set the
cradle down on the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/gs11.png" width="325" height="400" alt="Puss and baby" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please look after the baby," said the little
mother, "while I get the supper?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Puss, "but I'm not used to
babies, and perhaps he'll roll off the porch."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can keep him from doing that,"
replied the little mother, "he's the best baby
in the world!" So Puss sat down and played
with him for almost half an hour. By and
by a little bird began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Dance to your daddie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My bonnie laddie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dance to your daddie, my bonnie lamb.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You shall get a fishy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On a little dishy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You shall get a fishy when the boat comes home."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Pretty soon after that the little mother carried
the baby into the house.</p>

<p>Puss followed her into a cozy room, where,
on the mantlepiece, stood a tick-tocky clock,
just striking six. The tablecloth was spread
and everything was ready for supper. Over
in the corner hung a cage, in which sat a big
green parrot.</p>

<p>"Polly want a cracker?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want a cracker," replied the
parrot; "I want a little mouse."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Puss, "you don't mean to
say you don't like crackers?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm tired of them," said the parrot.</p>

<p>"Did you ever eat a raisin cracker?" said
Puss, with a grin.</p>

<p>But the parrot didn't reply. Pretty soon
he opened the door of his cage and came out.
Puss was all alone in the room, for the mother
had taken the baby upstairs.</p>

<p>"I'm going to fly out of the window,"
exclaimed the parrot. "I'm tired being
alone all day in this house." And before
Puss could stop him, he opened the window
and flew away.</p>

<p>"The parrot's gone!" cried Puss running
to the foot of the stairs. Then he rushed out
into the yard and found the parrot perched
on the limb of an old apple tree.</p>

<p>"I won't come back!" he cried. "I won't!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<h2>SAILORS TWO</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"THERE was an old woman of Glo'ster,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose parrot two guineas it cost her,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But his tongue never ceasing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Was vastly displeasing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To the talkative woman of Glo'ster."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Now as soon as the old woman who lived
next door saw Puss, Junior, climb the tree
to catch the parrot who had flown out of the
window, she cried, "Don't let the pussy cat
get you, Polly."</p>

<p>But goodness me! As soon as the old
woman's parrot heard that he was up in the
tree with the other parrot, and then they both
began to scream, "I won't come back! I
won't come back!"</p>

<p>"I don't care what they do," said the old
woman, "I'd much rather have a cat for a pet
than a parrot, anyway. He has been a
dreadful care ever since my son, who is a
sailor, brought him home."</p>

<p>So Puss looked down from the tree and
said, "Then would you rather I didn't catch
your parrot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, let him go," said the old woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I must catch the other one," said
Puss.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to get a pair of wings,
my dear Sir Cat," cried the parrot. "You
may be Puss in Boots, Junior, but you can't
fly. So I bid you farewell," and away he
flew, and then the old woman's parrot clapped
his wings and followed him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/gs12.png" width="281" height="350" alt="Parrots" title="" />
</div>

<p>So there was nothing for Puss to do but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
come down from the tree. And then all of a
sudden the old woman cried, "Why, here
comes my son," and a sailor boy jumped
over the fence and threw his arms around her.</p>

<p>"My ship just got in to-day, mother," he
cried, giving her a big hug. And after that
he looked at Puss, and said, "Shiver my timbers,
but that's a fine cat you have, mother."</p>

<p>"He's not mine," answered the old woman,
"but I wish he would stay with us, my parrot
has just flown away."</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam," said Puss, "but I
must be on my way to find my father, Puss
in Boots."</p>

<p>"We sail to-morrow," said the sailor boy,
"why don't you come aboard ship? You'll
have a fine trip, and maybe you'll find your
father at the first sea-port we reach."</p>

<p>"Good idea," cried Puss, "I'll go with
you."</p>

<p>"All right, my hearty," cried the sailor
boy, slapping Puss on the back, "you and I
will be pals. A sailor's life is the life for me."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be a sailor, too," cried Puss,
"and to-morrow we will sail the ocean blue."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>A WONDERFUL SHIP</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"I &nbsp; SAW a ship a-sailing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-sailing on the sea;</span><br />
And it was full of pretty things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For baby and for me."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Puss, Junior, "A sailor's
life is the life for me." The good ship was
at the dock, and her crew of sailor boys were
ready to cast off the mooring lines. Puss,
Junior, had been promised a sailor-suit as
soon as the ship's tailor had the time to
make it.</p>

<p>Just then the little woman who hung her
baby's cradle on the willow tree by the old
mill, came walking down to the dock.</p>

<p>"Are you going, too?" asked Puss, helping
her with the cradle, for she had walked a
long way and was very tired.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she replied, "because it's
full of pretty things for baby and for me."</p>

<p>"How jolly!" cried Puss, dancing about
on his toes. "We'll have a fine trip."</p>

<p>"That's what the 'rusty, dusty' miller said,"
cried the baby's mother. "He told me this
morning when I put the cradle in the 'Rock-a-by'
willow tree that the ship was sailing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to-day and that they needed a cook; so I'm
going to ask the Captain if I may cook and
bake for you all. I know how to make the
nicest cookies you ever ate. You just wait
and see what nice things we will have to eat."</p>

<p>Then Puss helped her over the gang-plank,
for the crew was busy loading the good ship
with all kinds of things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/gs13.png" width="298" height="350" alt="On the dock" title="" />
</div>

<p>Pretty soon the miller came running down
the dock. "Here is a sack of flour," he
panted, "I thought you might need some for
muffins."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't that fine?" said Puss, leaning over
the rail. "There's nothing like having plenty
of food aboard in case the voyage is a long
one."</p>

<p>"I don't know where we are bound," said
the baby's mother, "but baby will like it, I'm
sure. One can 'rock-a-by baby' on the sea as
well as on the old willow tree."</p>

<p>"I heard," said the 'rusty, dusty' miller,
as he laid the heavy sack of flour on the deck,
and wiped the perspiration from his forehead,
"that</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There were sweetmeats in the cabin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And apples in the hold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sails were made of silk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the masts were made of gold."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Why, so they are," cried Puss, gazing
up at the beautiful tall shining masts. "They
are of gold, of course they are. Look, baby,"
he cried, "see the gold masts."</p>

<p>"He's too young to know whether they
are made of gold or good old oak," said his
mother, "but we'll teach him to be a good
sailor, won't we, Puss, dear?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>ALL ABOARD!</h2>


<div class='cap'>"ALL aboard!" shouted the Captain.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"The four and twenty sailors<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That stood between the decks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Were four and twenty white mice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With chains about their necks."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"There's a locket fastened to every chain,"
cried Puss. "What pretty lockets."</p>

<p>"Each little sailor mouse has a picture of
his mother in his locket," said the Captain,
who stood near by giving the orders. Now,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The captain was a duck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a packet on his back;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And when the ship began to move</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Captain cried, 'Quack! Quack!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Hello!" said Puss, Junior, stretching out
his right paw. "Hello, Captain! Aren't you
the duck that took me across the pond on
your back a long, long time ago. You told
me about your cousin, the Golden Goose,
don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"So I did," said the Captain, looking Puss
over. "Shiver my timbers if you're not Puss,
Junior!"</p>

<p>"The very same," replied Puss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"And haven't you found your daddy yet?"
asked the Captain as his good ship swung
away from the dock, her silk sails filling with
the breeze until they looked like great big
balloons cut in half.</p>

<p>"No, Captain," replied Puss, sadly, "I
haven't."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll ask for him at every port,"
replied the kind master of the good ship,
which was now rolling and dipping in the
most graceful way possible. "I'll ask every
old land lubber on the docks when we touch
port. We'll hear some news, never fear."
And then the Captain went over to tell the
man at the tiller where to go. The "man" at
the wheel was a little white mouse, but he
knew how to steer the ship as well as any
pilot, let me tell you.</p>

<p>"I don't have to rock the cradle," said the
baby's mother, with a smile, looking up at
Puss, as he tip-toed over to where she sat.</p>

<p>"No, he's fast asleep," replied Puss, "and
the big blue ocean is rocking him better than
the willow tree."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rock-a-by baby, safe on the ship,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the foam-crested billows ripple and dip;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the breeze from the land of the big yellow moon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is turning the sail to a great white balloon."</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did you hear that pretty song?"
asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Why, I just made it up," replied the
baby's mother.</p>

<p>"Mothers always do that when they rock
their little ones to sleep, you know."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<h2>OLD TOM</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning the good ship came
in sight of an old seaport. The harbor
was very safe, for a tall white lighthouse
stood upon the rocks to guide the sailors, and
bellbuoys clanged their solemn warning from
the dangerous reefs. In the distance rose a
church spire, and near it stood a little red
schoolhouse with a flag flying in the breeze.
Down on the wharf ran a low row of buildings,
worn and battered, where the old sailors
lounged and told stories of their early
days.</div>

<p>Pretty soon the good ship came about, and
with her silken sails flapping in the wind,
drifted up to the dock.</p>

<p>"Make fast!" shouted the Captain. The
four and twenty little sailor mice jumped
nimbly on the dock, and in a few minutes
made the silk ropes fast to the posts. Then
the good ship came to a standstill, and the
gang-plank was lowered.</p>

<p>"All ashore that's going ashore!" quacked
the captain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh Captain Duck," cried Puss, Junior,
"we don't have to land, do we?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Duck. "But you may
go ashore for a little while if you wish. We
don't sail for two hours."</p>

<p>"All right!" replied Puss, "I'll take a
run on the grass," and he walked down the
gang-plank across the old wharf, until he
came to a path, well worn by the sailors who
for years had carried the cargoes up to the
little village. Under a tree close by sat an
old sailor. He was smoking a big black
pipe as contentedly as could be. But as
soon as he saw Puss he took it out of his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, my breezy little reefer," he cried.</p>

<p>"Good morning," replied Puss.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," said the old sailor.
"Just moor your little hulk alongside of old
Tom."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, my breezy little skipper?"
asked the old sailor after a few minutes
silence, for, Puss, you see, didn't know what
to say.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Puss, sadly, "only, I
can't find my father, the famous Puss in
Boots."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did he look like?" asked the old
sailor, with a grin.</p>

<p>"He looked like me&mdash;&mdash;or, rather, I look
like him," replied Puss.</p>

<p>"Well, my merry little sandpiper!" cried
the old salt, "you should have stayed at
home!"</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you," said Puss stoutly,
"I wanted to see the world."</p>

<p>"Give me your flipper," said the old sailor
kindly. "Good luck to ye. I hope you find
your daddy."</p>

<h2>A NEW PASSENGER</h2>


<div class='cap'>PUSS, JUNIOR, waved his paw to the
old sailor, who put his pipe back in his
mouth and smoked away contentedly under
the shady tree. All of a sudden a pretty
little girl jumped out from behind a stone
wall.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Bobby Shafto's gone to sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Silver buckles on his knee;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He'll come back and marry me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pretty Bobby Shafto.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bobby Shafto's fat and fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Combing down his yellow hair;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He's my love for aye and ere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pretty Bobby Shafto."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Hello," said Puss when she had finished
her song.</p>

<p>"Did you just get off that pretty ship,"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," replied Puss.</p>

<p>"Was Bobby Shafto on board?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him," replied Puss. "Did
you expect him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the little girl, "but
I run down to look every time a ship comes
to the old dock. And I always ask the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sailor who sits on the bench over there if he
has seen my Bobby."</p>

<p>"You're looking for your Bobby, and I'm
searching for my daddy," said Puss, sadly.
And then he told the little girl how discouraged
he was because in all his travels he had
not yet found him.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, they heard a
voice calling, "All aboard!"</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Puss, "I must
hurry; the ship's going to sail. Good-by!"
and off he ran to the dock as fast as he could.</p>

<p>"Wait for me," called out the little girl,
"I guess I'll go, too. I may find Bobby
Shafto."</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry!" cried Puss, looking back.
"I'll run ahead and ask the Captain to wait."</p>

<p>And it was lucky he did, for the gang-plank
was being hauled in just as he arrived.
"Wait for us!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't see anybody else," said the
Captain, as Puss stepped aboard.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," answered Puss, "There
she comes!"</p>

<p>And in another minute, with her bonnet
strings streaming in the wind, the little girl
came running down the dock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you for waiting," she cried, turning
to the Captain. "I'd have been so
disappointed if you had left me behind."</p>

<p>And then she stood close to Puss as the
good ship left the dock. "Good luck, my
little skipper," shouted the old sailor.</p>

<p>"Good-by," cried Puss, waving his cap to
the old salt.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h2>OVER THE WATER</h2>


<div class='cap'>WHEN the old dock and the gray-haired
sailor, the tall church spire
and the flag on the little red schoolhouse were
out of sight, Puss, Junior, turned to the little
girl and said: "Let's go down in the cabin.
I'll show you the cutest little baby you ever
saw. It's the 'rock-a-by, baby, upon-the-tree-top.'
His mother always hung the cradle on
a willow tree so that the breeze might rock
him to sleep. But now the ocean does the
rocking and baby sleeps almost all the time."</div>

<p>So the little girl followed Puss down the
stairs to the cabin, where they heard a sweet
voice singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Over the water, and over the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And over the water to Charley.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll have none of your horrid beef,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nor I'll have none of your barley:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But I'll have some of your very best flour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To make a white cake for my Charley."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"S-s-sh!" said the mother of the baby as
Puss and the little girl came in.</p>

<p>"Are you going to make a cake with the
flour the miller brought on board?" asked
Puss in a whisper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said the baby's mother. "But
what's your name?" turning to the little girl.</p>

<p>"She's looking for Bobby Shafto," answered
Puss.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/gs14.png" width="283" height="350" alt="Chatting" title="" />
</div>

<p>"What's your name, little girl," asked the
rock-a-by-baby's mother.</p>

<p>"Alice," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"A pretty name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it," said the little girl.
"And what is yours?"</p>

<p>"Mine? Oh, you can call me 'The Rock-a-by
Baby's Mother.'"</p>

<p>"Let's go out on deck," suggested Puss.
"Won't you come, too?" he asked, turning
to the baby's mother.</p>

<p>Rolling in the sea were huge black porpoises.
Over and over they rolled like great
footballs. Flying fish rose out of the water,
and overhead the gulls sailed back and forth
on their great wings. The breeze was blowing
strong and steady, and now and then
the salt spray came over the railing. Some
of it wet Puss, Junior's, whiskers.</p>

<p>"Did you get wet?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Not much," said Puss. "Besides, I don't
care for a little spray, anyway."</p>

<p>"Come over here and sit down on this coil
of rope," said the Rock-a-By-Baby's Mother,
and I'll sing you a song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rock-a-by, rock-a-by on the deep blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sailor Boy, Mother is dreaming of you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thinking of Sailor Boy out on the foam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hoping that Sailor Boy soon will be home."</span><br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<h2>CUSTARD AND MUSTARD</h2>


<div class='cap'>FOR several days the good ship, with the
four and twenty sailor mice and the duck
captain, sailed over the big blue sea. Puss,
Junior, learned to climb the mast and to run
out to the very tip of the great boom to tie a
rope for Captain Duck when it was blowing
a gale. The Rock-a-By-Baby's Mother
made a most delicious cake with the flour
which the 'rusty, dusty' miller had sent on
board, and altogether it was a most enjoyable
trip, and when the good ship put into port
on the fifth day everybody was sorry.</div>

<p>Even the little girl who was waiting for
Bobby Shafto to come home told Puss she
had forgotten all about him.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as the ship was fast to the
dock, Puss said good-by to Captain Duck
and the sailor mice.</p>

<p>"I hope Bobby Shafto will return soon,"
he whispered to the little girl as he kissed
her good-by.</p>

<p>"I shall miss you very much," he said to
the Rock-a-By-Baby's mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you, my dear Puss?" she answered,
giving him a hug. "You're a dear little cat!
I hope you soon find your father. When
you do, tell him he has a fine little son&mdash;tell
him that from me, won't you?"</p>

<p>And after that Puss went upon his way,
and by and by, after a while he found himself
on a broad highway. "I wonder what
will happen next?" he said to himself, and
just then he came to a small house near the
road. So he stopped at the front gate to
listen to a sweet voice singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When Jacky's a very good boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He shall have cakes and a custard;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But when he does nothing but cry</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He shall have nothing but mustard."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Puss opened the gate and peeped through
the window. In the centre of the room stood
a small boy, wiping his eyes with a little pink
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Nothing but mustard," repeated his
mother, "if you don't stop crying."</p>

<p>"Meow!" cried Puss at the window. "Won't
you give me some custard?" And then, my
goodness! didn't that little boy stop crying!</p>

<p>"Look at the cat with boots on!" he cried,
running up to the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"You both shall have some custard," said
Jack's mother, "and then you may go out to
the swing and have a good time."</p>

<p>Well, it didn't take long to eat the custard,
and then Jacky and Puss went out under the
big tree.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Swing high, swing low.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Away we go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Up to the skies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down to the ground;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the finest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sport I've found,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang Puss, Junior.</div>

<p>"After supper, Jacky, I'll tell you how I
was a sailor boy for almost a week on the
ocean blue!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2>ROWLEY FROG</h2>


<div class='cap'>NOW let me think what happened after
Puss finished telling how he had been
a sailor for a week on the ocean blue.</div>

<p>Oh yes, of course. He had scarcely said
good-by to the little boy when whom should
he meet but Mr. Rowley Frog and a big rat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/gs15.png" width="272" height="350" alt="Frog" title="" />
</div>

<p>"So you're going to make a call on Mrs.
Mousey," said Puss, as he and Mr. Rowley
Frog and the rat reached the dusty highway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir-ee," replied Mr. Rowley Frog.
"She lives just over there." And when Puss
looked across the meadow he saw a cute little
house.</p>

<p>"Looks like a pretty nice little place," said
the rat; "let's hurry along." So all three
started off on a run.</p>

<div class='poem'>
When they came to the door of Mousey's hall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
They gave a loud knock, and they gave a loud call.<br />
Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley!</span><br />
Oh, yes, kind sirs, I'm sitting to spin.<br />
</div>

<p>"I guess she's too busy," said Puss. "We'd
better not interrupt her."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," replied Mr. Rowley Frog,
bowing to Mrs. Mousey, who happened just
then to look out of her little window. Then
Mr. Rat took off his cap and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Pray, Mrs. Mouse, will you give us some beer?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
"For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer."<br />
</div>

<p>"Indeed, I will not," said Mrs. Mousey.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself! And
as for Mr. Anthony Rowley, he must throw
away that horrid cigar if he wants to call
on me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, goodness gracious! Didn't Mr.
Rowley look ashamed! He threw his cigar
away at once, and Mr. Rat hid behind Puss,
he was so embarrassed, and as soon as Mrs.
Mousey saw that they were both truly sorry
for what they had done, she smiled and said:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/gs16.png" width="273" height="350" alt="Frog by top hat and cane" title="" />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
"But let it be something that's not very long."<br />
"Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
"I've caught quite a cold, for it's damp in the bog."<br />
"Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
"I'll sing you a song that I have just made."<br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>But first she opened the door and invited
them in. "I'm not afraid of you," she said
to Puss, "for I know you are Mr. Puss in
Boots, Junior."</p>

<p>Well, just as soon as they were all seated,
she began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mrs. Mousey has a housey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Very small and trim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nice Swiss cheeses good for sneezes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Filled up to the brim.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Also candy, fine and dandy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ice cream soda, too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If you're nice to little mice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'll give some to you."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I'll see that my two small friends behave,"
said Puss, with a grin.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2>MRS. MOUSEY</h2>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT will you have?" Mrs. Mousey
asked Puss, Junior, as she opened the
cupboard door.</div>

<p>"I'll have a strawberry ice-cream soda,"
said Puss. So Mrs. Mousey poured some
red syrup into the glass and dropped in a
ball of ice cream, and after that she held the
glass under a regular soda-fountain spigot
which was fastened to a cute little ice-box.
"Fiz-z-z, fiz-z-z!" went the water until the
pink-colored foam almost ran over the edge
of the glass. But it didn't. Wasn't that
lucky?</p>

<p>"I'll take a pink and white peppermint
stick," said Mr. Rowley Frog, and Mr. Rat
said, "Cheese, if you please!" when Mrs.
Mousey asked him what he would have.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"But while they were all a merry-making,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho!" says Rowley.</span><br />
"A cat and her kittens came tumbling in."<br />
</div>

<p>And, oh dear me! Puss dropped his soda-water
glass, and it broke all to smithereens.
And then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
The cat she seized the rat by the crown:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heigh-ho! says Rowley.</span><br />
The kittens they pulled the little mouse down.<br />
</div>

<p>And after that the cat jumped through
the open window with the rat and disappeared
around the house, and the kittens ran out of
the door with poor Mrs. Mouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/gs17.png" width="291" height="350" alt="Having sodas" title="" />
</div>

<p>Puss jumped through the window, but before
he could catch them they ran into a hole
just big enough for them to squeeze through,
and Puss was left outside, wondering what to
do. The old cat was nowhere to be seen.
She had taken good care to get out of sight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for she knew that Puss, Junior, would take
Mr. Rat away from her if he ever caught
her.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He took up his hat, and he wished them good night."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I'll go home to mother," he said when he
reached the roadway. "I am getting homesick.
I think the old pond is the best place
for me."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Home, sweet home, in the dear old pond,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That is the place for me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll never go even a foot beyond,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'll sit there and croak, and never will smoke,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In my pond by the grassy lea!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"That's right," said Puss, as he hurried
along with Rowley, who, now that he had
made up his mind, could not get home fast
enough.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A wise frog stays in his bog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sits and croaks upon his log."</span><br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<h2>A SAD ENDING</h2>


<div class='cap'>"I'M very sorry for poor little Mrs.
Mousey," said Puss, as he and Mr.
Rowley Frog hastened toward the pond.</div>

<p>"So am I," answered Rowley. "She was
very generous with all her good things to
eat."</p>

<p>"And the poor rat," continued Puss. "It
was a sad ending to our little feast. I guess
he's been eaten up by this time. That
naughty old cat looked very hungry."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear," sobbed Rowley, the
tears rolling down his face, "I want to get
home. I'll never run away again."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So there was an end of one, two and three,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Rowley.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Rat, the Mouse and the little Frog-gee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With a rowley, powley, gammon and spinach,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heigh-ho, says Anthony Rowley!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"This is dreadful," cried Puss, as he saw
his small friend disappear down the duck's
long neck; "it has been a sad day. All three
of my little friends are gone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind," cried the lily-white duck,
looking up at Puss standing mournfully by
the side of the brook, "Frogs are good to eat,
and if they will run away from home, it's
their own lookout. They should stay in their
ponds and not go wandering about strange
places."</p>

<p>Puss did not answer. It seemed pretty
hard to meet such a sad fate, and he did not
like the lily-white duck at all.</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried the duck, "cheer up,
I'll ferry you across the brook if you wish
to reach the other side."</p>

<p>"That's kind of you," said Puss, seating
himself on her back.</p>

<p>"I'm not such a bad sort of duck," she continued,
paddling swiftly toward the opposite
bank, "but I must eat, and frogs are mighty
good eating, let me tell you."</p>

<p>As she finished speaking she waddled up
the bank, and Puss sprang nimbly from her
back. "Thank you, Mrs. Duck," he said,
"indeed, I'm obliged to you; but I wish you
hadn't eaten my friend, the little frog."</p>

<p>Just then nine little yellow ducklings waddled
toward them. "These are my children,"
said Mrs. Duck, very proudly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you, my little ducklets?" cried
Puss.</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you," they answered.
It was a pretty sight to see those yellow
balls of down cuddle up to their mother, and
Puss began to feel that, after all, she must
be a good sort of duck, for her children loved
her so much. Perhaps he had judged her
too harshly for gobbling up the frog, and
when she turned to Puss and said:</p>

<p>"Come home with us, Mr. Puss," he forgave
her for what she had done, and followed
her downy, yellow brood.</p>

<h2>BEAVER DAM</h2>


<div class='cap'>PUSS, JUNIOR, had gone but a short distance
when he heard a sad voice say:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh dear, I've lost my brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where will I ever find another?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He never should have left the bog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Alas, Alas! poor Rowley Frog!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Dear me," cried Puss to Mrs. Duck and
he looked about him for the owner of the
sad croaky voice. Pretty soon he saw a big
bullfrog in a brook.</p>

<p>"Come along with me," cried Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>Just then a little muskrat jumped out of
the water and from behind a tree ran a pretty
gray squirrel and a striped chipmunk.</p>

<p>"Did you call us?" they asked Puss all at
once.</p>

<p>"No, my little friends," he replied, "but
come along," and when they reached Beaver
Dam, they looked around to see what had
become of the old bullfrog. There he was
in the water about halfway down the stream,
swimming away for all he was worth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/gs18.png" width="297" height="400" alt="Following Puss" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Ker-chunk, ker-chunk!" he cried, as he
came up to them, "Why don't you wait for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
a fellow? And why didn't you tell me you
were going up stream?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Puss, Junior, felt very sorry to think that
he had really forgotten all about the old bullfrog.</p>

<p>"Well, you got here all right, didn't you?"
asked the muskrat. "Now," he continued,
"I'm going to knock three times on the dam
to let Mr. Beaver know that we would like
to cross."</p>

<p>After giving three loud knocks, Mr. Beaver
looked over and said: "What's the matter?
Who are you? What do you want? Where
did you come from? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"We'll answer the last question first," said
Puss, Junior, with a grin. "We'd like to
cross over on your beautiful great big dam."</p>

<p>"The toll is a penny," said the beaver,
looking them over carefully.</p>

<p>"I haven't got a penny with me," said the
little squirrel, "but I have a dandy big nut,
if that will do."</p>

<p>"All right," said the beaver, "give me the
nut." He put it in his pocket, remarking
as he did so, "it looks like a good nut. I
only hope I shall not be disappointed when
I crack it."</p>

<p>Turning to the chipmunk, he said, "What
have you got?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little acorn," answered the chipmunk.</p>

<p>"I don't want any more nuts," said the
beaver, disgustedly. "I'm not particularly
fond of nuts, anyway. I only took this one
from the squirrel because I knew he didn't
have anything else."</p>

<p>"Here are two pennies, Mr. Beaver&mdash;one
for Chipmunk and one for me," said Puss,
Junior.</p>

<p>"All right, Sir Cat," said the beaver,
"walk across, but see that you do not slip,
for the water is very deep on the upper side."</p>

<p>Puss carefully wended his way over, followed
by the little squirrel and the chipmunk.
The old frog swam over, as did the muskrat.
When they all reached the other side, Puss
went forward, followed by his small comrades,
who stretched out behind him like a
funny little army.</p>

<p>They hadn't gone very far, when a rabbit
jumped out from behind a bush. Puss,
Junior, called out, "Don't be frightened.
We won't hurt you."</p>

<p>"Baby!" cried the squirrel, "you're bigger
than I am, but you're twice as much afraid."</p>

<p>"I'm going to a wedding," said the rabbit.
"I've no time to wait!" and away he went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed the squirrel.
"I had forgotten all about Cock Robin's wedding!
I must be going."</p>

<p>"And so must I," cried the chipmunk and
the beaver, but what the old bullfrog said I
will tell you in the next story.</p>

<h2>DUCKLINGS</h2>


<div class='cap'>WELL, you will certainly agree with
me that the old bullfrog, in the last
story, is a wonderful fellow when you hear
what he says about Mrs. Duck, and, it is all
in poetry, too.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Old Mother Duck has hatched a brood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of ducklings, small and callow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their little wings are short, their down</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is mottled gray and yellow."</span><br />
<br />
"There is a quiet little stream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That runs into the moat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where tall green sedges spread their leaves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And water lilies float."</span><br />
<br />
"Close by the margin of the brook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The old duck made her nest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of straw, and leaves, and withered grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And down from her own breast."</span><br />
<br />
"And there she sat for four long weeks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In rainy days and fine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Until the ducklings all came out&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"So this is your home," said Puss, Junior,
as Mrs. Duck stepped into her nest, followed
by her brood.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"One peeped out from beneath her wing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One scrambled on her back;</span><br />
"That's very rude," said old Mrs. Duck;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Get off! quack, quack, quack, quack!"</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you do when it rains?" asked
Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"What do we do when it rains?" repeated
Mrs. Duck, "why, what do you suppose a
duck's feathers are good for? They shed the
water as well as a barn roof. Yes, even better,
for feathers are water-proof and shingles
are not."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/gs19.png" width="286" height="350" alt="Leading the ducklings" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, my good Mrs. Duck, of course it's
all right for you and your family, but should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it rain, what would I do? I couldn't possibly
crawl under your wings."</p>

<p>"Not very well," laughed Mrs. Duck.</p>

<p>"But it's not going to rain," cried one little
duck, peering out from between her feathers.
"I know it's not going to rain, for there isn't
a cloud in the sky."</p>

<p>Then all the little ducklings poked their
heads out and cried, "It's not going to rain,
it's not going to rain!"</p>

<p>"If it should, and there's no telling lately,
for the weather has been so unsettled, I could
take you up to the barnyard and introduce
you to Molly Head," said Mrs. Duck, turning
to Puss, Junior. "She has charge of all
the poultry and is a very kind woman, very
kind indeed."</p>

<p>"If I knew where to buy an umbrella,"
said Puss, after a pause, "I wouldn't mind a
little shower, but you know how a cat hates
to get wet."</p>

<p>"Yes, they make as much fuss over a little
water as a hen does," laughed good Mrs.
Duck.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<h2>A LESSON IN WADDLING</h2>


<div class='cap'>PUSS, JUNIOR, was very tired with
his journey, so he cuddled up in the long
grass close to Mrs. Duck's nest and he was
soon fast asleep. Then Mrs. Duck tucked in
her yellow ducklings and they were soon
dreaming of nice fat worms and little silver
fishes. By and by Mrs. Duck closed first
one eye and then the other, and pretty soon
she was asleep.</div>

<p>The wind played little lullabys in the tall
grass and the brook close by murmured over
its pebbly bottom. The crickets in the
meadow made sleepy little noises, so that it
must have been over an hour before anybody
woke up.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Tis close," said Mrs. Duck, shoving out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The eggshells with her bill,</span><br />
"Besides, it never suits young ducks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To keep them sitting still."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So, rising from her nest, she said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Now, children, look at me:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A well bred duck should waddle so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From side to side&mdash;d'ye see?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I'll play duck too," said Puss, jumping to
his feet and imitating Mrs. Duck. The ducklings
looked at Puss in wonder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'd make a fine duck," said one little
duckling.</p>

<p>"If he had feathers instead of fur," laughed
Mrs. Duck.</p>

<p>"If he had yellow stockings like ours," said
another duckling, "instead of red-topped
boots."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/gs20.png" width="277" height="350" alt="Ducks swimming" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Stop your quacking," cried Mrs. Duck.
"Did you hear what I said about waddling
just now?"</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Yes," said the little ones, and then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She went on to explain:</span><br />
"A well bred duck turns in his toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I do&mdash;try again."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Puss, Junior, turned in his toes exactly the
way they did, which made them laugh; even
Mrs. Duck chuckled. "Look out," she cried,
"or Puss, Junior, will do it better than you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Puss with a
grin.</p>

<p>"Won't you try to do better?" said Mrs.
Duck, turning to her brood with an anxious
expression on her kind face.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Yes," said the Ducklings, waddling on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"That's better," said their mother;</span><br />
"But well bred ducks walk in a row,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Straight, one behind the other."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I wish I had a drum," cried Puss, "I'd
beat time. We could make believe we were
soldiers." But Mrs. Duck did not answer.
"Do your best," she said to her little brood.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Yes," said the little ducks again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All waddling in a row.</span><br />
"Now to the pond," said old Mrs. Duck.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Splash, splash! and in they go.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I wish I could swim," cried Puss; "it
looks like great sport!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOW TO BE A DUCK</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"LET me swim first," said old Mrs. Duck,<br />
"To this side, now to that;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There, snap at those great brown-winged flies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They make young ducklings fat."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"See who can swim the fastest," cried Puss.
"Why don't you have a race?" The nine
little ducklings stopped.</p>

<p>"Line up in a row," cried Puss, "and when
I cry 'Go!' swim as fast as you can, and the
one who reaches this bank first wins. I'll
give a bright penny to the winner."</p>

<p>All the ducklings arranged themselves in
a row, and when Puss cried "One, two, three,
go!" they paddled away as hard as they could.
Back and forth went their little yellow feet.
Such a splashing! Nearer and nearer they
came. One little duck flapped his wings upon
the water and in this way managed to get
ahead. He was the first to land.</p>

<p>"Here is your penny," cried Puss.</p>

<p>"What can I do with it, mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can get a stick of candy to-morrow,"
replied his mother. "Not this afternoon, for
it is time now to go home to the farm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Now when you reach the poultry yard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The hen-wife, Molly Head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will feed you with the other fowls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On bran and mashed-up bread."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Duck came out of the water and
shook herself well, sending quite a shower of
water in little drops all about her. Puss
jumped back to avoid a shower bath. The
ducklings stood up on their toes and flapped
their small wings. Then off they all went,
Mrs. Duck in the lead. Puss followed behind,
taking care not to step on the yellow toes
of the last duckling.</p>

<p>As they neared the barnyard Mrs. Duck
turned and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The hens will peck and fight, but mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I hope that all of you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will gobble up the food as fast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As well bred ducks should do."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The woman who took care of the poultry
yard was already there. From a well filled
pan she was scattering handfuls of corn in
all directions. There were a great many
chickens, who darted hither and thither, picking
up the grains of corn. When the corn
was all gone she set down a dish of food. No
sooner had she done this than Mrs. Duck exclaimed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"You'd better get into the dish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Unless it is too small;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In that case, I should use my foot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And overturn it all."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The ducklings did as they were bid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And found the plan so good</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That from that day the other fowls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Got hardly any food.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"My, but she's a wise old duck," said Puss
to himself with a grin.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2>"WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY"</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was a queer looking house that Puss,
Junior, saw in the distance. It seemed
more like a box, with another little box tacked
on, through the top of which rose a long
piece of stove pipe, which, I suppose, served
as a chimney, although chimneys are usually
made of bricks in Old Mother Goose Country.</div>

<p>On the front porch sat a little old man,
smoking a pipe, from which the smoke drifted
away in little gray clouds, while the smoke
from the stovepipe chimney stretched out
like a long black feather.</p>

<p>"Good-day," said Puss, taking off his hat.</p>

<p>"Come and rest beside me," said the old
man, pushing forward an armchair. So Puss
sat down, and after wiping the perspiration
from his forehead remarked, "A warm day,
my good sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the little old man,
"but all days seem very much alike to me."</p>

<p>"Do they?" asked Puss. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you the story of my life,"
said the little old man, and, taking his pipe
from his lips, he began:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"When I was a little boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I lived by myself,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all the bread and cheese I got</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I laid upon the shelf.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The rats and the mice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They made such a strife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That I was forced to go to town,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And buy me a wife.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The streets were so broad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the lanes were so narrow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I was forced to bring my wife home</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In a wheelbarrow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The wheelbarrow broke,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And my wife had a fall.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Farewell wheelbarrow, wife and all."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"And have you lived alone ever since?"
asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old man, "and the mice
and the rats give me no peace. They eat up
all my cheese and flour."</p>

<p>"I'll help you," said Puss. "Let me stay
here to-night, and I'll catch every rat and
mouse that bothers you inside the house."</p>

<p>"You can make up poetry as well as I
can," said the old man, with a laugh. "Why,
that's the first laugh I've had in many a long
year. I like you, Sir Cat. You are an obliging
sort of person. You shall have the best
that my small home affords. I only hope
you will rid the place of rats and mice."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," replied Puss, with a
grin.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<h2>GOOD RIDDANCE</h2>


<div class='cap'>NOW, let me see. In the last story we
left little Puss, Junior, in the house of
the old man who brought his wife home in a
wheelbarrow. Well, Puss heard him take off
his shoes and get into bed, and then out went
the light. I guess the old man leaned out of
bed and blew it out. But Puss didn't go to
bed. Oh, my, no! He slipped off his red-topped
boots, so as not to frighten the rats
and the mice and stole softly over to the
window. The moon was bright and the stars
were twinkling in the sky.</div>

<p>"It's a long time since I've been a mouser!"
laughed Puss to himself. "I wonder if I
have lost my cunning?" And he sat down
by the window and crossed his leg over the
other. "Not a creature was stirring, not even
a mouse," and it was not the night before
Christmas, either. Pretty soon the sound of
scampering feet caught his ear, and, turning
his head, he saw a dozen mice or more running
over the floor, and after that two big
rats stole softly across the old rag rug in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
front of the fireplace. With a leap, Puss
landed close to the rats, and with his right
paw, laid hold of the nearest, and with his
left paw caught the other. "Squeak, squeak!
Oh, let us go!" they cried.</p>

<p>"Not unless you promise to leave this
house," replied Puss, fiercely, his whiskers
standing out straight and his eyes glaring
like two balls of fire.</p>

<p>"We will, we will!" squeaked the rats.</p>

<p>"Then go!" cried Puss, "and don't you
ever come back!"</p>

<p>"We won't, we won't!" cried the terrified
rats.</p>

<p>And after that Puss softly crept into the
kitchen, where on the table sat three little
mice eating a piece of cake. In a second
Puss had them fast in his claws.</p>

<p>"Squeak, squeak!" screamed the little mice.</p>

<p>"I'll spare you," said Puss, glaring at
them with eyes as bright as automobile lamps.
"I'll let you go if you'll promise to leave this
house with all your sisters and brothers and
cousins and aunts and fathers and mothers
and grandmothers and grandfathers, and all
your friends, and everybody else that I can't
think of, for I'm so mad I could eat you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh don't," they cried; "we'll go, we'll go!
We'll promise to leave."</p>

<p>And after that the little old man was never
bothered with rats and mice.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2>MISTER FOX</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was late in the evening as Puss, Junior,
entered a gloomy forest. It was very
dark beneath the big, tall trees, so by and by
he stopped and looked about him, when all
of a sudden&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"A fox went out in a hungry plight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he begged of the moon to give him light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For he'd many miles to trot that night."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Well, as soon as the Fox had finished asking
Lady Moon to show him the way Puss
cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fox, take me with you, for I'm
lost in this forest." But goodness me! the
Fox was so frightened at the sound of Puss,
Junior's, voice that he jumped behind a tree.</p>

<p>"Who speaks to me?" he asked, faintly.</p>

<p>"Puss in Boots, Junior."</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the Fox, coming out from
his hiding place, "now I'm not afraid. At
first I thought you were a farmer; farmers
don't like me!"</p>

<p>"Why should they?" asked Puss. "You
steal their ducks and chickens."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Softly, softly!" whispered the Fox;
"someone may hear you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;">
<img src="images/gs21.png" width="328" height="400" alt="Fox" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Very well," replied Puss, "I'll whisper if
you'll show me the way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come along," replied the Fox. So they
walked along through the dark forest, and
every now and then the moon peeped through
the tree tops to help Mr. Fox find his way,
but for all that, the forest was very gloomy
and Puss nearly stumbled two or three times
and so did Mr. Fox.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"At first he came to a farmer's yard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the ducks and geese declared it hard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That their nerves should be shaken and their rest be marred</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By the visit of Mister Fox."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Do you hear what they say about me?"
asked the Fox in a whisper.</p>

<p>"They say you give them bad dreams," replied
Puss; "that you keep them awake and
ruin their nerves."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Fox, "what do
they expect? Do they imagine I come here
to sing them to sleep? To stand under the
coop window and sing a lullaby? Ha, ha!
I'm very fond of duck and very fond of
goose, but not in that way. Oh, my, no!"
And he grinned until all his long white teeth

<h2>MR. SLIPPER-SLOPPER</h2>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Mr. Fox laughed he showed all
his long, sharp teeth, and Puss was
mighty glad he had his trusty staff with him
in case Mr. Fox became ugly. But nothing
unpleasant happened, and by and by they
came to the hen-house.</div>

<p>Puss was peeking through a crack in the
boards, but before he had time to utter a
cry of warning, Mr. Fox,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Seized the black duck by the neck,<br />
And swung her across his back;<br />
The black duck cried out, "Quack! quack! quack!"<br />
With her legs hanging dangling down.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and away he went, out through the door,
across the barnyard and up the hill. And I
guess Lady Moon wished she hadn't shown
that bad old fox the way through the dark
forest.</div>

<p>And after that Puss pounded on the
kitchen door and shouted, "The fox has run
off with the black duck!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Slipper-Slopper.
"Who has taken the black duck?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/gs22.png" width="295" height="400" alt="Blowing the horn" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Hurry up!" called Puss. "The fox has
a good start; 'twill be hard to catch him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>So Mrs. Slipper-Slopper pulled in her
head and pretty soon came thumping down
the stairs and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Which way did the fox go?" asked Mr.
Slipper-Slopper.</p>

<p>"Up the hill," said Puss.</p>

<p>"Where's my gun?" asked Mr. Slipper-Slopper,
turning to his wife.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember, John?" she
replied. "You lent it to old Neighbor Jones
last week."</p>

<p>"So I did," said Mr. Slipper-Slopper.
"Too bad!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going after him, anyway,"
cried Mr. Slipper-Slopper, picking up the
broom. "If I catch him I'll hit him a
whopper!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't hit an old man like Neighbor
Jones?" cried Mrs. Slipper-Slopper excitedly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;&mdash;the fox," cried Mr. Slipper-Slopper.
"I mean the fox."</p>

<p>"You'd better put on your boots," said his
wife. "You can't go in your slippers."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<h2>A DINNER INVITATION</h2>


<div class='cap'>GOODNESS me, Mr. Slipper-Slopper
took so long to pull on his boots that
Puss said, "Really, if you don't hurry the
fox will be miles away, and you'll never get
back your gray goose."</div>

<p>"Yes, John, you had better take this
young cat's advice," cried Mrs. Slipper-Slopper.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Then John, he went up to the hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he blew a blast both loud and shrill;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Says the fox, 'This is very pretty music&mdash;still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I'd rather be at my den.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed Puss to himself,
"Mr. Slipper-Slopper is crazy. Why does
he blow his horn? It's bad enough to hunt
a fox with a broom!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Slipper-Slopper," he
cried, "you have no boots&mdash;you've nothing
but slippers. You have no gun&mdash;you've nothing
but an old broom. And what's more,
you have no sense. You deserve to lose your
gray goose and your black duck. Good-by."
And Puss ran off in disgust.</p>

<p>"I've no use for a man who can't protect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
his own," he muttered to himself. "I won't
help catch that fox. Let him have a feast.
He must eat as well as Mr. Slipper-Slopper.
Probably Mr. Slipper-Slopper would have
killed the gray goose for dinner in a few days,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Helloa, what are you talking about?"
cried Mr. Fox, jumping out from behind a
large stone.</p>

<p>"So you think old Slipper-Slopper would
have killed the goose and eaten it himself,
do you?" asked the fox with a grin.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Puss, startled at the
sudden appearance of Mr. Fox, "I thought
it pretty mean of you to steal his goose, but
now that I've found out what a foolish man
Mr. Slipper-Slopper is, I'm glad you have a
good dinner in store for yourself and family."</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you," said Mr. Fox,
with another grin.</p>

<p>"Neither have I forgotten that you helped
me out of the forest," continued Puss, "and
I feel very friendly toward you."</p>

<p>"If that's the case," said the fox in a kind
voice, "you come home with me and Mrs.
Fox will give you some of the best roast duck
you ever tasted in your life."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2>ROAST DUCK</h2>


<div class='cap'>PUSS, JUNIOR, accepted the invitation
of Mr. Fox to dine, for he was hungry,
and the very thought of roast duck for supper
made his mouth water.</div>

<p>"Thank you, Mister Fox," he answered.
"Let me carry the duck for you&mdash;the goose
is enough of a load!"</p>

<p>"You are right," replied the fox, handing
the duck to Puss. "It was a hard run up
that hill. If I had known the farmer better,
however, I wouldn't have hurried so."</p>

<p>"Well, lead the way, and I'll follow," said
Puss.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"At last the fox got home to his den;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To his dear little foxes, eight, nine, ten,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Says he, 'you're in luck, here's a good fat duck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With her legs hanging dangling down.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"This is Puss in Boots, Junior," he said,
turning to his good wife, Mrs. Fox. "He has
carried the duck for me, for I have a big
fat goose."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Fox asked Puss to sit down and
rest while she cooked the supper, and the
little foxes begged him to tell them a story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"What kind of a story do you like?" asked
Puss.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/gs23.png" width="284" height="400" alt="Fox with the duck" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Tell them how I crept into the hen-house
and got away from old Mr. Slipper-Slopper,"
said Mr. Fox. "You keep them quiet and
I'll pluck off the feathers while Mrs. Fox
heats the oven. Then we'll lose no time in
roasting the duck."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," replied Puss, "I'll tell them
about it," and as soon as Mr. Fox went out
of the room Puss commenced.</p>

<p>"Your father and I crept softly into the
barnyard and then your daddy tiptoed into
the hen-house and said to Madam Goose:
'By your leave, I'll take you away and carry
you home to my den Oh!' I'm not quite sure
whether he or Madam Goose said 'Oh!' but
that doesn't make any difference."</p>

<p>"I think it must have been Madam Goose,"
said a little fox. "I think she was frightened."</p>

<p>"Maybe you are right," said Puss, with
a smile. "At any rate, when your father
caught the black duck there was no mistake
about what she said, it was 'Quack! quack!
quack!'"</p>

<p>Well, just then Mr. Fox came in and said
dinner was ready.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He then sat down with his hungry wife.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They did very well without fork or knife.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They never ate a better goose in all their life;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the little ones picked the bones!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>And Puss, Junior, had all he could eat, too.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<h2>TAFFY</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
"TAFFY was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I went to Taffy's house, Taffy wasn't home,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow-bone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I took the marrow-bone and beat about his head."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"Well, I guess you did what was right,"
said Puss, Junior, as he and Tom Thumb
neared a butcher shop in a small village.</p>

<p>The butcher, who had just spoken in
rhyme, shifted from one foot to the other in
an uneasy sort of way. "But that isn't all,"
he went on to say, in rather an anxious tone
of voice.</p>

<p>"Tell us the worst, then," laughed Puss,
Junior, who didn't appear very sympathetic,
although the name Taffy appealed to him
and made him wonder what sort of a person
Taffy was.</p>

<p>"The truth of the matter is," the butcher
went on to say, "I hit him a bit too hard with
the marrow-bone. His head is in bad shape,
and the doctor says it will be some weeks yet
before Taffy gets out of bed."</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed Tom Thumb.
"Why weren't you more careful?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just it," replied the butcher.
"Why wasn't I more careful?" And then he
gave a sigh and went into his shop to wait
on a customer.</p>

<p>"Let's make a call on Taffy," said Puss,
Junior. "Somehow, I can't help liking him.
I don't know whether it's on account of his
name, or not. But Taffy sounds awfully
nice to me."</p>

<p>"It tastes awfully good to me," laughed
Tom Thumb. "You must have him mixed
up with candy. That's the reason you like
him, I guess."</p>

<p>"Come on and we'll soon find out," cried
Puss, Junior. "I'm curious to see what
'Welsh Taffy' is like." So they both walked
up the street, inquiring on the way where
Taffy lived. If the house Taffy owned was
any indication that Taffy was a nice sort of
person, it certainly spoke well for him, for
it was the prettiest and most homelike little
place Puss had ever seen.</p>

<p>"I like him already," said Puss, as he
knocked on the door.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>A KIND VISIT</h2>


<div class='cap'>OF course, Taffy didn't come to the door.
But a little Welshwoman did, and
dropping a courtesy, she invited Puss and
Tom Thumb to come in.</div>

<p>"How is Taffy?" Puss asked.</p>

<p>"His head is still painful," replied the
little Welshwoman, "but for that he feels
quite well, thank you," and she dropped another
courtesy.</p>

<p>"May we see him?" asked Tom Thumb.</p>

<p>"Well, that I don't know," she replied,
"but I will enquire. Won't you step into
the sitting room?" So our two small visitors
walked in and sat down. The little canary
bird hopped about in her cage and the flowers
in the green boxes in the bay-window nodded
in the sunlight, as the big old clock in the
far corner ticked away the minutes.</p>

<p>"Come up and see Taffy," suddenly cried
the voice of the little Welshwoman.</p>

<p>I guess Puss had almost fallen asleep
listening to the drowsy tick of the old clock
and the low twitter of the canary. Everything
was so quiet and home-like it reminded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
him of his old home when he had prowled
about in the garret and discovered the story
book, "Puss in Boots." Yes, Puss, Junior,
felt a little bit homesick, for "no matter how
humble, there's no place like home."</p>

<p>Taking Tom Thumb by the hand, he followed
the Welshwoman up the stairs, where
they found Taffy sitting propped up in bed,
his head done up in great bandages. But,
oh, what pleasant blue eyes he had! And his
red beard, big and soft, flowed down over
the counterpane, and his big strong hand lay
so quietly on his lap that Puss forgot he was
Puss in Boots, Junior, son of the Seneschal
to my Lord of Carabas, and jumped right
up on the bed and nestled up to Taffy, purring
away just like an ordinary cat!</p>

<p>And what did Taffy do? Did he say
"Scat! You'll get the counterpane all dirty
with your red-topped boots!" No, he didn't.
He just stroked Puss, Junior, with his big,
kind hand, and the little Welshwoman picked
up Tom Thumb and cuddled him in her
bosom, saying in a low voice, "Dearie me, but
it's nice to have friends come to see you when
everybody in town is calling my Taffy a
thief."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>And then a tear fell from her eye on little
Tom Thumb's hat; but he didn't care, for
somehow he felt there must be some mistake,
and that Taffy wasn't to blame. And Puss
felt the same way, for he kept on purring
and rubbing his nose against Taffy's big
red hand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE RED BEARD</h2>


<div class='cap'>BY and by Taffy stopped stroking Puss,
Junior, and said in a kindly voice:</div>

<p>"Well, my fine little cat, what can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>Puss, Junior, didn't know just what to
answer. In fact, as he hadn't come for anything,
he couldn't think of anything to fit the
question. But little Tom Thumb, however,
called over from where he was sitting in the
Welshwoman's lap, that they had come to
call, and that they were strangers in town,
traveling through on a journey of adventure.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what they say about me?"
asked Taffy.</p>

<p>"Yes, we did," replied Puss, "but, somehow,
I didn't believe it then; and I'm very
sure I don't believe it now."</p>

<p>"Bless you for that," cried the little
Welshwoman, "my Taffy is no thief. There
has been a great mistake about it all."</p>

<p>"Yes, that there has," said Taffy, "but
how can I prove it? Someone with a red
beard stole the piece of beef from the butcherman,
and then they said it was I. But I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
never near his place, nor did I lay hands on
meat or marrow-bone."</p>

<p>At that moment there came a loud knocking
at the front door, and when the little
Welshwoman opened it, whom should she
find but the butcherman himself!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/gs24.png" width="264" height="350" alt="Butcherman at the door" title="" />
</div>

<p>"See what I have brought to you," he said,
holding up a false red beard. "I found this
to-day behind a barrel in my shop. It's like
your Taffy's beard." At this the little
Welshwoman opened her eyes very wide and
tried to speak, but she was so surprised she
couldn't.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>When the butcher went to say that perhaps
the man who wore this beard was the
one who had stolen his beef, the little Welshwoman
began to cry softly, and the big
butcher, who had a kind heart, said, "Don't
cry, my good woman, I don't think now
your Taffy stole the beef, and that's the
reason I've come all the way up here to show
you this beard. So you tell Taffy that I shall
tell everybody in town that it wasn't he who
stole my beef, but some thief who wore a red
beard: and then, I'll show them what I found
in my shop, and that will prove what I say.
Everybody will be glad to know that Taffy
isn't to blame."</p>

<p>As soon as the butcher had gone, she flew
upstairs to tell Taffy the good news. And
it almost made Taffy cry. If he hadn't been
a man, he would have. But it was hard work
not to, just the same. "My head feels better
already," he said with a laugh that had a
big catch in it.</p>

<p>"Take off the bandages, little woman. I'll
come down to supper, and these two small
friends of ours shall spend the night with
us, for they have brought us good luck to-day,
that they have."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<h2>ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>


<div class='cap'>AFTER leaving Taffy, the Welshman,
Puss, Junior, and little Tom Thumb
walked along for many a mile until they came
to the seashore. Right there in a sheltered
cove lay a beautiful sailboat, on the stern of
which was painted in gold letters:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Take, oh take me for a sail&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I can weather any gale."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Shall we accept the pretty boat's offer?"
asked Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>For answer Tom Thumb jumped in and,
so without another word, Puss hoisted the
sail and steered for the big blue ocean. All
day and all night they sailed away, and when
they woke in the morning they were surprised
to find the little boat fast aground on
a sandy beach.</p>

<p>"How did we get here?" asked Puss,
sleepily, for it was still early in the morning,
and the sun had just begun to climb up to the
sky, and the dew dripped from the tall
meadow grass that grew close to the water's
edge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Through no fault of ours," replied little
Tom Thumb, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Captain Puss, Junior, fell asleep at the
helm, and the first mate, Tom Thumb, did
likewise," he added, running up to the bow
and looking over the land. "Why, it's an
island," he called out. "I can see water on
the other side."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," said Puss. "Well,
let's land." So they jumped ashore and
walked up the beach towards a clump of
trees.</p>

<p>"Pretty nice sort of a place," said Tom
Thumb. "Let's play Robinson Crusoe! I'll
be your black man Friday. We can build a
house under these trees, and as we have lots
to eat on board ship, we can spend some time
here without danger of starving."</p>

<p>And just then, all of a sudden, a voice
began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Poor old Robinson Crusoe!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Poor old Robinson Crusoe!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They made him a coat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of an old Nanny Goat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wonder how they could do so!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With a ring-a-ting, tang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a ring-a-ting, tang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Poor old Robinson Crusoe!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Who's that?" whispered Puss, Junior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
But he needn't have asked the question, for
just then a man dressed all in skins came
toward them.</p>

<p>"Friends or enemies?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Friends!" cried Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"Friends!" screamed Tom Thumb.</p>

<p>"Welcome, then, to my island. I am
Robinson Crusoe!"</p>

<p>Puss and Tom were too amazed to answer
for a few minutes. Then Puss, Junior,
stretched out his right paw, saying: "I'm
very pleased to meet you, Mr. Crusoe."</p>

<p>"And so am I," said little Tom Thumb,
standing on tiptoe and reaching up his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, you're certainly as welcome as the
flowers in May," said Robinson Crusoe.
"Visitors are few and far between. Come
with me to my house."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h2>CRUSOE CASTLE</h2>


<div class='cap'>ROBINSON CRUSOE'S home was
unlike anything Puss, Junior, had ever
seen. Notwithstanding that he had visited
many strange places and met many strange
people, he was greatly surprised at Robinson
Crusoe's style of dwelling. It wasn't exactly
like a fort, and yet it was one. Tom Thumb
said it reminded him of some of the strange
castles he had seen while with Good King
Arthur.</div>

<p>It stood against the side of a small hill,
surrounded by a high stockade. There was
no door to it, but while Puss was wondering
how they were going to get in, Robinson
Crusoe placed a ladder against the wall and
climbed up, saying, "Follow me, my friends;
this is the way we enter Crusoe Castle."</p>

<p>After reaching the top they descended by
the same ladder, which, of course, was pulled
up and lowered on the inside. A very nice
looking tent met their eyes, back of which
was a large cave hollowed out of the rocky
hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is where I live, my little friends,"
cried Robinson Crusoe. "This is my dog,
Snoozer, and my two cats, Caromel and
Caroline."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/gs25.png" width="302" height="375" alt="Climbing a ladder" title="" />
</div>

<p>Puss had never been very fond of dogs,
but Snoozer came forward in such a respectful
way that Puss took a liking to him at
once. I suppose there were so few visitors
at Crusoe Castle that Snoozer would have
welcomed even a strange cat.</p>

<p>With Caromel and Caroline, however,
matters were different. Caromel from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
first was jealous of Puss. You see, he had
no fine, red-topped boots, nor a sword and
feathered cap. Caroline, however, made up
for him. She thought Puss, Junior, just
about the handsomest cat she had ever seen.
Poor Caroline! She had never been off of
Crusoe Island.</p>

<p>For all that, however, I don't think if she
had been all over the wide, wide world she
would have met such a handsome cat as Puss,
Junior. No, indeed! Puss, Junior, was the
Prince of Cats; that goes without saying,
though we have said it.</p>

<p>"And now that we have all been introduced,
let us sit down and talk," cried Robinson
Crusoe, "for I've hardly spoken to a soul
for many years. I've forgotten how a voice
sounds."</p>

<p>So they all began to talk and laugh and
to tell all sorts of jokes and riddles until it
began to grow dark. Then Robinson Crusoe
jumped up and said, "Come and watch me
get supper, for I am Lord and Chief Cook
of Crusoe Castle."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<h2>FRIDAY</h2>


<div class='cap'>PUSS, JUNIOR, and Tom Thumb enjoyed
their supper at Crusoe Castle
better than any meal they ever had. "Even
when I visited the Man in the Moon, the
cheese wasn't as good as this," said Puss.</div>

<p>"Glad you like it," said Mr. Crusoe, "I
made it myself from goat's milk. I have
some fine goats, let me tell you. I made me
this coat from an old Nanny goat. Do you
wonder how Crusoe could do so?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose there are no tailors on
Crusoe Island," said Tom Thumb.</p>

<p>"I've never met any," replied Mr. Crusoe
with a laugh. "I've never met anybody so
far except goats and kids, parrots and
monkeys, ducks and drakes, snakes and
lizards."</p>

<p>"Where did you get Snoozer and Caromel
and Caroline?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"They came off the ship with me when it
was wrecked," said Mr. Crusoe. "That is,
I brought them off the next day when I went
out on the raft to the wreck. And they've
been with me ever since."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," Puss, Junior, suddenly
exclaimed. "Is Friday here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," cried Tom Thumb, "where is
Friday?"</p>

<p>Mr. Crusoe got up and walked over to a
tall pole and looked over carefully the
notches cut into the wood. "Let me see," he
said. "To-day is Thursday. Yes, that's
right; Friday will be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake, Mr. Crusoe,"
said Puss, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Have I," he replied, looking over his
wooden calendar carefully a second time.</p>

<p>"I don't mean the day," said Puss. "I
mean your man Friday."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean my black man Friday,"
said Mr. Crusoe. "Oh, I gave him a holiday.
He'll be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I'm very anxious to see him," said Tom
Thumb.</p>

<p>"He'll be surprised when he sees you, too,"
said Mr. Crusoe, with a grin. "He's never
seen a white man but me."</p>

<p>By this time it was quite dark, so Mr.
Crusoe lighted some very nice home-made
candles and stuck them here and there in
the cave. They gave a very soft light. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
waves on the beach murmured gently, and
pretty soon Snoozer was snoring and Caromel
and Caroline were fast asleep on an old sack
in a corner.</p>

<p>"Let us turn in," said Mr. Crusoe, showing
Puss and Tom a very comfortable hammock.
In a short time everybody was sound
asleep and snoring away in Crusoe Cave.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<h2>SUPPOSING</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE loud ringing of a bell awoke everyone
in Crusoe Castle. Puss, Junior,
jumped out of his hammock and little Tom
Thumb yawned and asked in a sleepy voice,
"Who's ringing the door-bell?" Then Mr.
Crusoe picked up the ladder and went outside
and, placing it against the fence, climbed
up to the top, and after that he pulled up the
ladder and then let it down on the outside.
All this time Snoozer stood below wagging
his tail, while Mr. Crusoe's two cats, Caromel
and Caroline, purred and rubbed against the
calendar pole. Pretty soon a curly-headed
black face appeared above the wall.</div>

<p>"Black man Friday," whispered Tom
Thumb.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow!" yelped Snoozer, and in a few
minutes Mr. Crusoe and his man Friday
climbed down the ladder.</p>

<p>"This is my good man Friday," said Mr.
Crusoe. So Puss and Tom Thumb shook
hands with him, which seemed to please him
immensely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Glum-glum. Blum-blum!" he cried, smiling
and showing a row of very white teeth.</p>

<p>"That's 'Howdy! Pleased to meet you,'
in his language," said Mr. Crusoe. "He can
talk very little English yet. I've had little
time to devote to his education so far."</p>

<p>"But who rang the bell?" asked Puss,
Junior.</p>

<p>"Why, Friday did, of course," replied Mr.
Crusoe. "Come over here and I'll show
you," and he led Puss to the rear of the cave.</p>

<p>"I brought this bell from the wreck," explained
Mr. Crusoe. "After Friday came to me
I tied a rope to it. At the other end of the
rope I fastened a door-knob. When I go out
Friday usually stays in. And when I ring
the bell he lets down the ladder to me. And
when he's out he rings the bell, just as he did
this morning, and I let the ladder down to
him."</p>

<p>"What do you do when both of you go
out?" asked Puss. "Does Snoozer attend to
the ladder?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Mr. Crusoe. "We hide
the ladder in the woods nearby. Then when
we come back we get it out and stand it up
against the wall and climb up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Supposing someone should come across
the ladder and make a call while you're out?"
asked Tom Thumb.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know whether they'd think
of that if they just happened to find the
ladder," answered Mr. Crusoe.</p>

<p>"Well, supposing they did," said Tom
Thumb.</p>

<p>"Caesar's Ghost!" cried Mr. Crusoe. "Suppose
we don't do any more supposing! I've
been so long alone that I've forgotten how
to play that game. Let's all go down to the
beach and get some fresh soft clams for
breakfast. Start the water boiling, Friday,
we're going to have steamed clams for breakfast."
And then Mr. Crusoe climbed up the
ladder, with Puss and Tom Thumb close at
his heels.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<h2>THREE MEN IN A TUB</h2>


<div class='cap'>ON reaching the seashore, Robinson
Crusoe raised a spy glass to his eyes
and looked carefully over the water. And
then all of a sudden he lowered the glass and
whispered: "The cannibals are coming! We
must go back to my fort at once."</div>

<p>"Do they eat cats?" asked Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Mr. Crusoe. "You
see, I've never met a cannibal; in fact, I've
always held aloof from them."</p>

<p>Crusoe's man Friday was nearly frightened
to death. He was as pale as a black ghost,
which is pretty white for a negro.</p>

<p>Once inside the fort, Mr. Crusoe again
took a look at the cannibals. "Why, I guess
I've made a mistake," he cried; "it's a tub,
not a canoe!"</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Rub-a-dub-dub!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Three men in a tub;</span><br />
And who do you think they be?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The butcher, the baker,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The candlestick maker,</span><br />
Turn 'em out knaves all three!"<br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's good news," cried Puss,
Junior, while Black Man Friday jumped
about in great glee. You see, he had escaped
only a short time before from the cannibals.</p>

<p>Little Tom Thumb, although safe inside
Puss, Junior's, pocket, was also relieved.
The only one who didn't seem overjoyed was
Mr. Crusoe himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/gs26.png" width="271" height="350" alt="In a tub" title="" />
</div>

<p>"What's the matter now?" said Puss.</p>

<p>Mr. Crusoe gave a deep sigh. "If you
owed the butcher, the baker and the candlestick
maker as much as I do you wouldn't
be overjoyed at seeing them, either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'd rather see them than cannibals,"
cried Tom Thumb. "I'd rather they'd take
my money than my life!"</p>

<p>"That's very true," said Mr. Crusoe, "but
you don't quite get me. The laws on this
island are very strict. They will allow you
to shoot a cannibal at sight but not your grocery
man."</p>

<p>"Then you are powerless against these
three men in a tub?" said Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," replied Mr. Crusoe.
"I needn't answer the bell, you know."</p>

<p>By this time the three men had landed on
the beach, and pretty soon the doorbell rang.</p>

<p>"S-s-sh!" whispered Mr. Crusoe, "don't
make a sound. They can pull the handle off,
for all I care."</p>

<p>They didn't do this, but they kept the bell
going until every one in Crusoe Castle was
nearly crazy. First the butcher took a hand,
then the baker, and then the candlestick
maker. Then they began all over again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<h2>A BIG FISH</h2>


<div class='cap'>"IF those fellows don't stop ringing that
bell, I'll get out my gun," said Robinson
Crusoe. "I didn't get the bell for
them; it's all paid for long ago."</div>

<p>At that moment, the bell-cord snapped,
and the baker, who had just given the handle
a dreadful yank, fell over backwards and
rolled down the hill to the beach.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crusoe's not at home," said the
butcher. "We might as well go back." So
he and the candlestick maker went down to
the shore and joined the baker; and then all
three got into the tub and sailed away.</p>

<p>"And we must do the same," said Puss,
Junior. "Tom Thumb and I thank you very
much for our nice visit on your island, but
it's time we went forth again on our journey
of adventure."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry to see you go," said Robinson
Crusoe. And after that Puss shoved
off the little boat and soon he and Tom were
far out of sight on the big, wide sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"When the wind is in the East,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Tis neither good for man nor beast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the wind is in the North,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The skilful fisher goes not forth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the wind is in the South,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It blows the bait in the fish's mouth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the wind is in the West,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then 'tis at the very best."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Well, as the wind is in the South, why
don't you fish?" cried Captain Puss, Junior.
So Tom Thumb started in, and presently he
felt a tremendous tug on the line.</p>

<p>"I've got a fish! I've got a fish!" he cried,
and then he began pulling in his line as fast
as he could. But, oh dear me! It wasn't a
fish after all, but a great big whale!</p>

<p>"Don't you pull on that line any more,"
cried the whale, "if you do I'll smash your
boat."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so," said little Tom Thumb,
although, of course, he was frightened almost
to death, but what was the use to show fear?
It would only make things worse, and if he
put on a bold front, perhaps the whale would
let them alone.</p>

<p>"I'll take the hook out of your nose, if
you'll promise not to swallow me," said little
Tom Thumb.</p>

<p>"All right," said the whale, and then Tom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
tried to pull it out. But it was in so tight
that the whale began to spout great big tears.
"Oh, dear me! It hurts just like a tooth!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's your own fault!" said Tom.
"Next time don't swallow everything that
comes along!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<h2>MARY LEE</h2>


<div class='cap'>"IF you're not more careful, I'll spout
water over your boat and sink it," cried
the whale, growing tired of Tom Thumb's
fruitless endeavors to get the fish hook out.
"My nose is bleeding now and the hook is
still in it."</div>

<p>"Let me give the string a yank," said Tom
Thumb. "Didn't you ever have a tooth
pulled out that way? It won't hurt much."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead," said the whale, closing
his eyes and shutting his teeth tight. And
then out came the hook and over went Tom
into the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Ouch!" said the whale, while little
Tom Thumb picked himself up and said to
Puss, Junior, "Don't you ever ask me to fish
again in the ocean. I'd rather fish like
Simple Simon."</p>

<div class='poem'>
Simple Simon went a-fishing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to catch a whale;</span><br />
All the water he had got<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was in his mother's pail.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"What are you grumbling about?" asked
the whale, peering over the side of the boat.
"One would think you had been caught with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a hook," and saying this disagreeable thing,
he dived down into the sea.</p>

<p>"No more fishing for me," laughed Tom
Thumb.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/gs27.png" width="311" height="400" alt="At the gate" title="" />
</div>

<p>And just then they came close to a lighthouse
on a big rock. So they ran the boat up
on the little stretch of sand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what we're landing for,"
said Captain Puss, Junior, "only I've never
been in a lighthouse and here's a good
chance."</p>

<p>"Haven't you?" asked a pretty voice, and
a young girl appeared on the stone steps leading
down to the beach. "Come, my gallant
tars, and I'll show you my lighthouse and
after that you can tell me some of your
adventures, for 'tis a lonely life I lead here
alone on the rock until my Bobby Shafto
returns."</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bobby Shafto's gone to sea</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In his schooner Mary Lee.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hard-a-port, or hard-a-lee,</span><br />
"Hasten, Bobby, home to me."<br />
</div>

<p>So Puss picked up Tom Thumb and followed
the girl into the lighthouse and up the
stairs to the very top where the great lamp
sent out its rays of light to guide the ships
at night; or the great bell clanged in foggy
weather to warn the weary sailor from the
cruel rocks.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<h2>STORY-TELLING</h2>


<div class='cap'>AFTER they had seen everything there
was to be seen they all went into the
cosy kitchen, Puss, Junior, with Tom Thumb
on his shoulder and the pretty girl who kept
the lighthouse.</div>

<p>"And now we shall have supper," she said.
"And after that, when the lamp is lighted in
the tower, we'll sit outside on the doorstep
and Puss, Junior, shall tell me one of his
adventures."</p>

<p>"Well, what shall I tell and where shall I
begin?" asked Puss, when they all were
seated outside the lighthouse.</p>

<p>"Tell me how you and Tom became fellow
travelers," said the girl, taking Tom up in
her hand and placing him on her knee.</p>

<p>"Willingly," said Puss, stroking his
whiskers and curling his great mustache,
"and should I make a mistake in the telling
Tom may correct me.</p>

<p>"When I left my father at the Castle of
my Lord of Carabas I had gone but a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
miles when I came to Tom Thumb's house.
And as soon as his mother saw me she asked
me to go to King Arthur's Court and find
out about her son, Tom Thumb. She had
made him but a few days before a small cambric
parasol, and with this as a sort of airship
he had floated off on the wind to the castle.
When I got there I found that poor Tom
was imprisoned in a mousetrap. He had
fallen into the dough which the royal baker
was about to bake into cakes for King Arthur.
And this had so angered the baker that he
had thrown Tom into a mousetrap."</p>

<p>"It was worse than that, I was to be
beheaded," interposed Tom. "I owe my life
to Puss, Junior."</p>

<p>At this, Puss actually blushed, for he was
a modest little cat, although he had traveled
much and had been royally treated.</p>

<p>"Say not so, my dear Tom," he cried, "for
King Arthur was only too glad to comply
with my request when I asked him to release
you. In fact, it was not because he feared my
sword, but because he liked my rhyme."</p>

<p>"How did it run?" asked the girl. And
Puss, blushing still more deeply, commenced
to recite this little verse:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"My good King Arthur rules this land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With justice and a generous hand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Far be it that a cat should plead</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In vain that Tom Thumb shall be freed."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Is that what you said?" cried little Tom
Thumb. "Dear, dear Puss, I shall never forget
what you did for me!"</p>

<p>Dear, dear! Here we are at the end of
the book and poor little Puss, Junior, has
not yet found his father. Maybe he will in
the next book.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE END</div>

<b>Handsomely Bound. Colored Wrappers. Illustrated.</b><br />
<b>For Children 6 to 12 Years.</b><br />

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>This series presents early American history in a manner
that impresses the young readers. Because of George and
Martha Washington Parke, two young descendants of the
famous General Washington, these stories follow exactly
the life of the great American, by means of playing they
act the life of the Washingtons, both in battles and in
society.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS</div>

<p>Their thrilling battles and expeditions generally end in "punishment"
lessons read by Mrs. Parke from the "Life of Washington." The culprits
listen intently, for this reading generally gives them new ideas for further
games of Indian warfare and Colonists' battles.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' RELATIVES</div>

<p>The Davis children visit the Parke home and join zealously in the games
of playing General Washington. So zealously, in fact, that little Jim
almost loses his scalp.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' TRAVELS</div>

<p>The children wage a fierce battle upon the roof of a hotel in New York
City. Then, visiting the Davis home in Philadelphia, the patriotic Washingtons
vanquish the Hessians on a battlefield in the empty lot back of
the Davis property.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS AT SCHOOL</div>

<p>After the school-house battle the Washingtons discover a band of gypsies
camping near the back road to their homes and incidentally they secure
the stolen horse which the gypsies had taken from the "butter and egg
farmer" of the Parkes.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' HOLIDAYS</div>

<p>They spend a pleasant summer on two adjoining farms in Vermont.
During the voyage they try to capture a "frigate" but little Jim is caught
and about to be punished by the Captain when his confederates hasten in
and save him.</p>

<h2>THE FLYAWAYS STORIES</h2>

<h3>By ALICE DALE HARDY</h3>

<div class='center'>Author of The Riddle Club Books<br />

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />


<b>Individual Colored Jackets and Colored Illustrations by</b><br />

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>
<p>A splendid new line of interesting tales for the little
ones, introducing many of the well known characters of
fairyland in a series of novel adventures. The Flyaways
are a happy family and every little girl and boy will want
to know all about them.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE FLYAWAYS AND CINDERELLA</div>

<p>How the Flyaways went to visit Cinderella only to find that Cinderella's
Prince had been carried off by the Three Robbers, Rumbo, Hibo and Jobo.
"I'll rescue him!" cried Pa Flyaway and then set out for the stronghold of
the robbers. A splendid continuation of the original story of Cinderella.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE FLYAWAYS AND LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD</div>

<p>On their way to visit Little Red Riding Hood the Flyaways fell in with
Tommy Tucker and The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. They told
Tommy about the Magic Button on Red Riding Hood's cloak. How the
wicked Wolf stole the Magic Button and how the wolves plotted to eat up
Little Red Riding Hood and all her family, and how the Flyaways and
King Cole sent the wolves flying, makes a story no children will want to miss.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE FLYAWAYS AND GOLDILOCKS</div>

<p>The Flyaways wanted to see not only Goldilocks but also the Three
Bears and they took a remarkable journey through the air to do so. Tommy
even rode on a Rocket and met the monstrous Blue Frog. When they
arrived at Goldilock's house they found that the Three Bears had been there
before them and mussed everything up, much to Goldilock's despair. "We
must drive those bears out of the country!" said Pa Flyaway. Then they
journeyed underground to the Yellow Palace, and oh! so many things happened
after that!</p>
